"i am a single mother. as a child, i was molested by my mothers boyfriend. i never knew my father. i started having children at 18 right after high school. after having children, i completely lost myself and gave all of my focus on my children. now my children are getting older, but i still dont know myself. ive had several attempts at relationships, and they all fail. i stopped caring about a lot after my childrens father left me. i fell into a spiral and got depressed.","what your are experience is normal for most women. we usually forget about self and totally focus on our children putting our personal wants and needs aside. so to answer your question of how do you get to know yourself i usually do a 6 session course with my client by having them answer questions such as the following in the first session: what do i love? (other than your children) what are my own needs and desires? what 3 things have i accomplished in my life that im most proud of? what are 5 strengths or qualities i have? what is one event that had a major impact on my life? how have that event affected my life today? for their homework assignment after the 1st session, they are asked to write a letter to self tell self what they love, cherish, appreciate and even admire about themselves. most women feel awkward at first, but i remind them that the truth is that only to the extent that you are able to love and value yourself, you are to love and support others."

"im a guy. if i dont like girls, nor do i like guys, does that mean im gay?","hi, and thanks for your question. i agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality, but i want too add a couple of things about that:here is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality - are a whole lot of myths surrounding asexuality. one is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex, and that is not always the case. there are variations of asexuality. some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others dont. also, once you read more on this topic, you may find that you dont connect with asexuality either, and that is okay. our society usually thinks of sexual orientations as only being straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, but the truth is there are many variations of sexual orientations. keep exploring. there is a good chance that there is a community of people who feel like you do. finally, labels are important for a lot of things, but labeling ourselves can sometimes lead to some painful feelings. try not to feel pressured to label yourself too quickly. this is your journey. your experience. take all the time you need. you may never feel the need to label how you feel, and that is okay, too. hope this helps. be well.robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc"
"i have no friends, no hobbies, and no interest in anything. i get annoyed with everything and everyone. i am always tired, i can sleep 8 hrs or 12 hrs and im still tired. i dont know what to do. is this normal?","hello, and thank you for your question. it certainly sounds like you dont like how things are going. here are a few thoughts and ideas:1. if you havent seen a primary care provider in a while, you may want to. there are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels, even at your age. it doesnt hurt to get checked out. if they find the cause, they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms. in addition, most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild, moderate, and sometimes severe depression. so, dont be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an anti-depressant if they diagnose you with depression. medication is not the only way to treat depression, but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors.2. you may want to consider counseling, since it is another effective way to treat depression. a counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place. this could include thoughts, behaviors, beliefs, life experiences, and other things. 3. finally, to answer your question about whether these feelings are normal. these symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition. it is important to remember that even if these symptoms are abnormal it doesnt mean that you are. millions of people struggle with depression. so remember, the symptoms are the problem, not you. hope this helps. be well.robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc"
"i am a female, and i am afraid of having sex. i am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. i think he thinks im not a virgin. i am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. i dont want my partner to think differently of me because i am afraid of having sex.","these fears are completely normal. almost everyone has the same fears you do, to some degree, especially if they lack experience. men also feel far more of these fears than you realize. that can help...to remember that were all a little scared and looking for safety and approval.you mention a partner, but im not sure if you currently have one. having a partner you can trust with your fears and who you feel safe with is so important. when youre really confident someone cares deeply for you, this can help the fears to go away or diminish. how well do you know your own body? getting to know how you like to be touched and how different touches feel...getting acquainted with your body yourself first...this can help build sexual confidence. in general, our partners care less about our fat and wrinkles than they care about how we make them feel in bed. being a generous lover who is confident enough to put fear aside...ironically this is what makes you good in bed. but be patient with yourself. your confidence will grow with experience, and that doesnt have to happen until you are ready. theres not rush. :)"

"my mother-in-law is mentally ill. she has been for most of her life. she cuts herself. she has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for about 40 years. she has voices in her head that tell her to cut herself. she has had multiple shock therapy treatments, and shes on enough medication to take down an elephant. her parental rights for her two children were taken away from her when my husband was a boyhe is now in his late 30s. she doesnt even have custody of herself. she hasnt asked yet, but she has been insinuating that she wants to babysit my child. how do i go about saying no without creating an issue?","hi fontana,thanks for providing all the details needed in order to respond to your question. it seems very clear to me that no would be the appropriate response. i like your healthy boundaries, and ill help you explore possible ways to respond to her. first, she hasnt asked yet, and you dont know that she will. right now, you can pleasantly ignore her hints. theyre not hurting you and if you ignore them, theyre more likely to go away. you can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision, and that if shes offended, that doesnt mean that youre being mean it means that she has unrealistic expectations. so, the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry. you might never have to face that moment. but, i understand that you want to be prepared.as her son, perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question, should it ever come. is he willing to do this? but if you are comfortable, and if youre the one she asks, you can confidently give her a simple, honest response about why it wont happen. and i would suggest presenting a firmly closed door, rather than saying but maybe later. no need to apologize or hum and haw...we love that you want to be around junior, and we definitely want you in hisher life. (try to leave out the but here). youre not in a healthy place, and were not comfortable with you caring for himher on your own.if she pushes the issue, this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries. id let her know that its not negotiable, that you understand if shes disappointed, but youre not open to discussing the issue. really, theres nothing to discuss. learning not to take responsibility for her emotions is part of having an ill person in your life. i wish you the best."
"i have family issues, and my dad was both violent and a cheater.","hi new york, theres no way to keep your past from affecting your present and future, because its a huge part of who we are. the good news is, though, that the effect doesnt have to be negative. im met many people who have horrific pasts and it helps them know confidently, every day, what kind of person they want to be and what kind of world they want to live in, and it helps them make really great decisions. you can accept your past, integrate your traumas and move forward in a very different way. if you see negative ways in which your past affects you (and this is also common), you are wise to seek professional help. without knowing more, its impossible to give you a lot of direction here. basically, our past creates emotional bruises that are touch on and triggered by present situations. but our reactions are often about more than just the present moment. i think you know that.i wish you the best as you sort it out."

"i have no idea what happened. i go places and do things but still feel lonely. i honestly have no friends, and i am always the one texting people and bothering people. i feel invisible, like someone that no one wants to be around.","a lot of times any and each of us creates what we need for ourselves by seeing other people as creating these circumstances and situations.is it possible that at this time period in your life, being alone is positive for sorting through your true values or sorting through key situations in your life?if yes, then possibly you are giving yourself some alone time, even though to some degree being alone is not your first choice.at the very least, since you arent happy with being the one who texts others, then some alone time may encourage new thoughts and ideas creating more open space within you to attract other people who do enjoy texting you first.also, most relationships are not forever. is it possible you are at a phase when some relationships are simply closing down so that you have clear space within your life for new and different activity?"

how does a person start the counseling process?,"most counselors are very approachable and many offer a 15 minute chat by phone to allow you to talk about your issue, and to get a feel for the counselor. if you like what you hear by phone, the next step is to set up a face-to-face meeting. studies show that the most important element in effective therapy is that you feel a connection with your counselor. trust your instincts and if you dont feel comfortable, let him or her know that you dont think its a good fit. many counselors list on websites like psychology today and good therapy. visit these websites to learn more about therapists in your area."

"i always feel the need to impress people, whether its my family, the people at school, or just random people. i know that no matter what i do or how i change, there will always be some people who hate me. why do i feel this way?","it is normal to seek others attention and noticing that some people would not be interested. after all, we belong to a social environment where we constantly receive others feedback, which at times validates us, makes feel important and useful, like we belong but also at times makes us feel isolated, different and neglected, which we could interpret as hate.the key is to be aware of what you think about what people think of you. got it? this part can be tricky at times, because, what others think about us does not really affect us, what really affects us is what we decide to believe, internalize, and make our reality. for example, i could choose to ignore a persons comment about me, or i could decide to focus on it all day, analyze why they said that and what have i done to them to get to that conclusion. eventually, since we became so focused on that thought, we may end up believing that what the other person said about us was true, even if we did not agree to begin with.so how can we fix this? awareness is the key! it is important that you understand the way you internalize external inputs, like comments, and to go through a process of discarding negative ones. it is also helpful to talk to your counselor about how you process feedback and validation so you learn to balance your positive traits from negatives and how that affects your relationships and self-esteem.cómo me puede importar menos lo que la gente piensa?siempre siento la necesidad de impresionar a otros, ya sea mi familia, la gente de la escuela o extraños. y sé que no importa lo que haga o cuanto haga, siempre habrá personas que me odian. por qué me siento así?es común que busquemos la atención de otros y notemos que algunas personas no están interesadas. después de todo pertenecemos a un ambiente social donde constantemente recibimos comentarios, que a veces nos validan, alagan y nos hacen sentir como parte importante y funcional de la sociedad pero en otros momentos nos hacen sentir aislados, ignorados y diferentes, lo cual lo pudiéramos interpretar como odio.la clave es estar conscientes de lo que pensamos que los otros piensan de nosotros. me sigues? esta parte puede ser algo confusa, porque lo que piensan otras personas de nosotros, no nos afecta directamente, lo que si nos afecta es lo que decidimos creer que otras personas piensan de nosotros y luego lo internalizamos y hacemos parte de nuestra vida. por ejemplo, podemos decidir ignorar lo que una persona dice de nosotros, o podemos decidir enfocarnos en ello todo el día, analizando en detalle porque lo dijeron y que hemos hecho para hacer que ellos piensen así. eventualmente nos enfocamos tanto en ese pensamiento, que terminamos creyendo que es verdad, aun cuando originalmente no lo creíamos así.entonces como lo arreglamos? la clave es concientización. es importante entender la manera en que internalizamos las opiniones de otros, y que pasemos por un proceso de discriminación, donde descartemos los comentarios negativos, hasta que aprendamos a ignorarlos. también ayudaría hablar con un consejero sobre como internamente validas y descartas los comentarios y opiniones externas, y como eso puede estar afectando tus relaciones y tu autoestima."

the last of my emotions belong to my pets. today my dad said he might get rid of them tomorrow. if that does happen i might dig hole in the ground with a paper that says here lays my emotions. r.i.p. i practically have no emotions left and i came to the realization about this not being normal by comparing my reaction to certain situations to my familys. whats wrong with me?,"it sounds to me like you have had a lot going on and now you are afraid you are going to lose the last things you care about, your pets. i do not know what all is going on in your family, and i cannot answer for your dads actions or his reasoning behind this.i would recommend that you focus on developing healthy coping skills. we cannot change what others do but we can change how what they do affects us. if you have all of your emotions and all of yourself tied up into one thing (like your pets) then when that thing is taken away it causes a lot of emotional distress. it is really good to have a wide variety of interests such as friends, hobbies, games, etc. develop other things that you care about and are passionate about.another reason for developing healthy coping skills to deal with whatever might be going on in your life is if you dont have healthy ones, you may develop some very unhealthy ones. you have to cope somehow, right? developing unhealthy ways of coping with life is only going to make life more difficult for you.i dont know if this is what it is like for you at your house, but there are two kinds of household environments that can cause dysfunction in children. one is when you grow up in a very rigid stern household where all decisions are made for you and you feel like you have no control over anything. the other is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to happen next and had no stability. people need to have some stability in their lives and need to feel in control over some things in order to feel safe. both of these environments can lead you to develop some unhealthy ways of coping with life. please talk to a trusted adult about your feelings before it gets any worse."
i am in my early 20s and i still live with my parents because i cant afford to live alone. my mother says that if i live under her roof i have to follow her rules. she is trying to control my life. what should i do?,"unfortunately you seem to have yourself in a double bind. by living with your mom she is not going to stop her attempts at what you perceive as controlling. there is no use in trying to debate or get her to see your point. as long as your there and you personalize her attempts at control, then you will find yourself frustrated and resentful. try to find an extra job or a roommate so that you can do the natural process of moving on out."

"my dad is always, and i mean always, cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all. he makes me feel stupid. he also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me. is this abuse?","yes, screaming and cussing at your child is considered abuse.here are two points i suggest you consider for your situation.if your dad is ever calm when you and him are with one another, ask for some time to talk about your relationship with him.schedule it for sometime in the near future from your request. this way he has time to consider his points of view on his relationship to you. even if he does no thinking about your relationship at all, he will not feel pressured by the surprise of suddenly being expected to talk about a topic he may prefer to prepare himself.my second point to you is to keep steady in your own views of who you are. when a parent demeans and mistreats a child, the child is affected in a negative way. concentrate on loving yourself and keeping people in your friendship circle who care about you."
im having trouble with my identity and dont know who i am. what can i do to feel more comfortable with my identity?,"its great that you recognize the need to feel more comfortable with your identity. we can work together to explore your identity and develop coping strategies that work best for you. some techniques that might help include journaling, talking to trusted friends and family members, and seeking therapy if necessary."

"ive been in an on an off relationship with a this man for almost 3 years. even though i care about him, he continues to hurt me. he and his wife were separated when we met. now hes going through a really difficult divorce from her and is taking it really hard. i want to end this relationship, but i dont feel like i can. how can i let go?","first decide what you truly would like in the current relationship. understand your reasons for staying in the relationship.three years is a substantial amount of time to be involved with someone. whatever attachment you feel toward this man is deep and complex.instead of deciding to leave or not leave, change your question to figuring out your satisfactions and dissatisfaction with the man. also important is to tell the man your feelings.whatever problem you are feeling may become clarified by discussing what bothers you.at the very least, you will give the guy a chance to show how interested he actually is in the tension you currently feel and have felt for a while."
"my fiancé and i have been together for 3 years and our relationship has always been good. the only issue we had was that he felt like he wasnt getting enough sexual attention from me. i recently found out he cheated on me with another women. he says he wants his family back but im confused on what to do. is it possible for us to get past the cheating, or should i just move on?","betrayal in a relationship can be one of the most difficult things a relationship can sustain. sometimes feelings about the betrayal may also trigger past wounds. the fact that it only happened once may not make it any easier to move forward. i highly recommend working with a mental health professional who has experience working around the issue of infidelity. together, you can work on healing the wounds and moving forward. i do believe it is possible to move forward, if both partners are ready and willing to do the work to move forward together and create a new vision for their relationship."

"im currently struggling with diagnosed depression, anxiety, and misophonia. also, i am 99 sure i have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder. i read the dsm-iv, taken college psychology, etc. i know it in my heart i have them. is self-diagnosing okay with the right research?","hello, and thank you for your question. self-diagnosing is something that we all do about one health issue or another. taking a guess about what may or may not be happening to us is completely normal, however the actual clinical diagnoses of a mental health disorder requires a licensed mental health professional. here are a few reasons for this: 1. making a clinical diagnosis often requires other things besides matching up the symptoms of a disorder. to come to a diagnoses for any of the things you mentioned, a counselor would consult the dsm, but they may also use some type of screening tool, assessment or scale. many disorders have similarities and it requires someone with training to tease out the differences in the symptoms. 2. our judgement is sometimes off when it comes to assessing ourselves. we really cant be objective. something as serious as determining a diagnosis really needs to be done by someone who has that objectivity. in addition, once you know your diagnosis, treating it usually requires help from a professional. 3. sometimes the symptoms of a mental health disorder makes self-diagnoses impossible, in and of itself. for example, someone could be having hallucinations or delusions and not realize it. that would clearly make it impossible for them to diagnose themselves. there a many examples where something like this could happen with different mental health disorders. there are other reasons, but these are three important ones. now, does this mean that you are wrong about your diagnosis? maybe not. you may be correct. but, it is important to get this confirmed by a professional mental health clinician. if a disorder is then found, you can begin to talk about treatment. hope this was helpful. be well.robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpcc, ncc"

"i was raped a couple months ago, since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, i have been having trouble feeling emotions. its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling. what can i do to change this?","you are describing a very legitimate reaction to trauma. rape is an aweful experience and i am very sorry that happened to you. when horrible things happen, people often react in a way that interferes with the ability to live a normal life and function the way they did in the past. this is very common and the goal is to help you manage the stress caused by dealing with negative events and with help you can regain emotional well-being. this is especially important if you have had more than one negative thing happen. oftentimes, the unconscious reaction is to become numb and avoid all feelings, especially if more than one negative event occurred. a big part of what causes people trouble are feelings of guilt. we often blame ourselves when bad things happen. it is actually difficult to comprehend the concept that we dont always have control of what happens in life. in addition, when you mentioned feeling like a sociopath, it sounded like you feel like your reaction is wrong. the first thing you can do is realize that your feelings and reactions are o.k., you arent doing anything wrong, and nothing is wrong with you. the next step is to start dealing with the impact of these traumatic experiences. identifying your feelings, and knowing the thoughts and beliefs that are behind those emotions can help you regain your sense of happiness. research shows that understanding and expressing those thoughts and feelings can help. if doesnt sound like you need to do anything to change yourself, but talking to a counselor can be helpful in managing your reaction to a incredibly traumatic experience. i hope this helps you understand your feelings and can get to a place where you enjoy life."

"i have suffered many things at home and school. we never went to the doctor to diagnose depression or anything like that, but i always feel like a part of my heart is missing. i try to fill it in with objects or, in this case, a woman.","there are a lot of ways to look at this. it sounds as if there is a part of you that is looking for support. i wonder what it is that you feel when youre not in a relationship?because of the way you asked the question, im getting the impression that you are referring to romantic relationships. i wonder if you have close friendships that could form a network to help with this when you are not romantically involved with someone. even when you are in a relationship with a romantic partner, having friends is still an important element.i wonder if you could also notice what changes for you inside of yourself (as far as emotions) when you move from not being in a relationship to being in one.perhaps you could take a look at what you value about yourself.in general, it is natural for people to want to be in relationships with others (in this case, relationship has many meanings and degrees). most of us enjoy sharing elements of our days, thoughts, feelings, etc. with someone else who we trust and care about also hoping they care about us in return."
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,"hello there. you ask about being nervous and shaky walking in to your therapy session and want to know if its normal? ... i realize there a few ways to look at this. i presume you werent anticipating feeling this way and probably hoped to feel the opposite.. well, my initial response is yes, sure, it can be within reason to feel this way. have you been in therapy before? is this somewhat new? that could be part of the reason. but either way new or not, i think when are entering into a meeting that holds potential evaluation of deep things about you and your heart and soul, it can cause anyone to tremble. the soul can be anticipating some things could be shaken up here, and it can feel scary to look at these things and then change. looking deep at our life can feel daunting and scary so your response just might be regards to potential growth trying to happen. or, is there something about the therapist you dont feel confident about? this too might be in play as a reason for your feelings... maybe you lack confidence in that therapist ? have you let your therapist know how you feel? that would be good to explore...i would like to encourage you to look at these ideas. hope it helps. let me knowkindly,keithkeithcounseling.com"

"i am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately. whenever i get close to being in a relationship, some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship. this anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. while a semi-relationship should be joyous, for me, its an emotional nightmare i cant get to the bottom of. ive had this before and had to leave the semi-relationship to avoid throwing up every time i made contact with my crush. what could be the reason behind this? is it massive nerve problems? is it a fear of a bad relationship? while im not quite ready to be in one anyway, i want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which i can be in one. i dont take medications and have no desire to, i have read forums, and ive talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems.","hi helena,i felt a bit sad when i read this. this is a new term for me... semi-relationship. what does it mean? i know that todays culture for young people is more of a hook-up culture than a dating one. maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. that makes me feel sad. i hear a lot of young women (im not sure youre female, but thats my guess) say that they struggle with hook-ups because they cant let themselves hope for a phone call after a hook-up. research tells us that, after a hook-up, college age women tend to feel used and unworthy, and men tend to feel guilty. i think this scenario works better for men than women, but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end.this is only one possible explanation for your anxiety...that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether its okay to want or expect that.maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. anxiety tends to try to convince us that somethings wrong with us or something bads going to happen. anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague (its more difficult to refute it then), but you can try to clarify its whisperings by asking yourself these questions: what am i afraid of? what is the worst thing that might happen here? then what might happen, and what would be the worst part of that? keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen? might someone not want you...might you feel rejected...or feel not good enough...you might get hurt?then when you find that core fear, you can look at your life and i bet youd find a place where that idea or fear originated. a big moment (or many smaller ones) when you actually did feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. in the end, its a feeling youre trying to avoid (not life or relationship), and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. but this doesnt work for you! good! with the help of a qualified therapist, you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm. confidence."

"i start counselingtherapy in a few days (im freaking out) but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","crying is a natural process when you talk about upsetting things especially in therapy when you are opening up and being so vulnerable. i suggest that you consider how you would feelrespond to someone that was confiding to you and they began to cry. if you felt concerned, supportive and empathetic then you know exactly how us therapists feel when our clients are emotional in sessions. i suggest that you think of times where you have cried and how you felt at that time in public and what would have helped to make you feel less uncomfortable during your tears. i think of crying like any other natural reaction of our body such as sneezing, laughing, coughing. you cant help but do those things and most people wont really judge negatively if you do it in public. similarly, crying is our bodys reaction when we are emotional whether it is tears of joy, from a hilarious joke or from being upset. if you are very uncomfortable about crying but willing to start therapy perhaps you can ask the therapist if you can turn your chair around if you begin crying. this way you are not facing them and can self soothe without worrying about how you physically look at that time.i wish you luck and you should be proud of yourself for starting therapy and i wish you a wonderful journey on this important path that you are embarking on."

my daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10. she then started to act younger than she is. now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age. i dont know why this is happening. is this normal?,"this is certainly an important issue to look into, it is always helpful to speak with the childs pediatrician since they are most familiar with the childs developmental history. also, children tend to regress behaviorally when facing events and interactions they feel to have no control over, this can be as simple as a loss of a pet, a recent move, death in the family, andor as serious as sexual abuse, and other things. if you have not spoken to the school that can be a good starting point."

"my mother and i have an okay relationship. i know she loves me unconditionally, and i love her the same. however, more times than not, im afraid to tell her anything personal because she either doesnt listen, she turns it around and makes everything about her, or she ignores things - even when they are about my mental health.","could you tell her ? what would happen if you said mom, i love you and i really want to share myself with you, but often i you get upset and i dont want that to happen. i really want to be able to talk to you."
"i get so much anxiety, and i dont know why. i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes.","the are two ways that such anxiety can be dealt with. one is an attempt to replace maladaptive thinking by examining the distorted thinking and resetting the fight-or-flight response with more reasonable, accurate ones. as an example im scared of spiders. but if you change the thinking from being scared to im bigger than the spider, it allows the mind to reach a calmer state of mind. mindfulness-based therapy can also help focus on the bodily sensations that arise when you feel anxious. instead of avoiding or withdrawing from these feelings, remain present and fully experience the symptoms of anxiety. instead of avoiding distressing thoughts, open up to them in an effort to realize and acknowledge that they are not literally true.although it may seem counter-intuitive, fully realizing the experience of anxiety enables the release of over identification with negative thoughts. you can practice responding to disruptive thoughts, and letting these thoughts go.by remaining present in the body, youll learn that the anxiety being experienced is merely a reaction to perceived threats. by positively responding to threatening events instead of being reactive you can overcome an erroneous fight-or-flight response."
"it was over 20 years ago, but the pain has resurfaced again now because i have started seeing her facebook posts about how great her life is. i feel so angry. how can i handle this?","emotional pain is different from physical pain that way, isnt it? even many years later, an old wound can be ripped open again by a small trigger.you were betrayed by two people close to you. thats a complex injury. i dont know whether youre still in the marriage or not, or whether your sister is still in your life. perhaps not, as your contact with her seems to be through watching her facebook activity. im curious about why youre just now seeing her facebook posts again. are you feeling more open lately to seeing how shes doing in her life? i guess if you were open to having your sister even in the periphery of your life again, you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers. if you cant, maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from facebook for a while. so your sister is happy, or she at least appears happy. your mind might go to some unhelpful places, like she doesnt regret the affair (you dont know that), she doesnt deserve happiness (that would be a harsh judgement), or she doesnt care that im hurt (again, theres no evidence of that). where does your mind go? its important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her. when you have those worst thoughts identified, ask yourself what evidence supports that thought as truth? its likely that either theres no evidence, or that the truth is so far from you that you cant know what shes feeling or thinking, which makes having those thoughts pretty futile.a therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here. it doesnt help you and your happiness to carry around resentment, ill wishes, or the need for revenge. forgiveness is not about saying that something was okay. its about saying it happened. i accept that i cant change it, and i dont want to carry the emotional burden around all the time. forgiveness is putting it down. she... (trust me this is true)...she carries her own burden of shame for what she did. for you to spend time feeling angry doesnt affect her burden. it only adds to yours. can you find the tender emotion under your anger? youre hurt. validate that hurt. honour that hurt. take care of that hurt. you can stay away from people who disregard your needs, and you have the power to forgive those who make mistakes out of their simple humanity if you want them in your life. if you continue to struggle, please seek the help of a professional who can assist you in navigating these waters. :)"

"my fiancé and i have almost the best relationship every girl wants, but lately its changed. i get less attention and little to no intercourse. he works a lot and goes to the gym a lot (hes a football player for an indoor league), but he has no time for me. we live two hours from family, and when i leave home to see family, hell text me saying whatever and leave me alone. but when were together, everything is okay. no fighting or anything. i love this man, but i just dont know what to do anymore.","hello, it doesnt feel good when it seems that your partner no longer cares or cares less for you, especially if your feelings have not changed. it can be scary, frustrating, and lonely. have you tried talking to him about your concerns? i would suggest to start there. there may be several reasons for his actions, some of which may have nothing to do with how he feels for you. learning about what is going on for him will likely answer your questions and, depending on his response, may cause some relief. when initiating conversations about subjects that are sensitive, there are a few things that you want to remember. tell him how you are feeling and what you are experiencing, rather than blaming him or telling him what he is doing wrong. avoid using extreme, black and white language (i.e. always and never). for example, you may say something such as, i feel confused that we are rarely intimate and im wondering if youve also noticed this change versus you are never intimate with me anymore. dont be afraid to ask him questions. you deserve to know what is going on, as his behavior is effecting your well being. i like to ask open-ended questions instead of yes and no questions. it allows for more clarity and deeper explanation. lastly, ask yourself (and possibly him) what part you play in the recent changes. does he feel that youve been distant? does he need something from you? let him know that you are willing to work things out as a team. if communication attempts fail, seeing a couples therapist can be a great benefit. having an objective party to coach you through this difficut time can give you the support that will create lasting changes in your relationship.best of luck to you!"

ive become so jaded that i cant control my thoughts. i cannot focus on anything and been having anxiety attacks.,"i imagine that its pretty disconcerting to feel as though you lost yourself.when you said that you are jaded, im not sure whether you mean that you are jaded toward someone, something, life in general, or some combination thereof.one of the difficult things about anxiety is that anxiety can lead to more anxiety because of being concerned about having another panic attack. consider remembering that panic attacks usually only last a few minutes and the reason they dont go away right away is because of the way your brain releases chemicals because some part of your brain is reacting as if you are in danger in some way.as far as finding yourself, you may consider looking at what parts of each day you can control as a way to stay centered. you could also focus on something that makes you feel happy andor comfortable.you may also consider the list of values here to give yourself an idea of what is most important to you, what it is that you are living by now, and what values you would prefer to live by. this proves to be difficult, consider seeing a local therapist."
is this something i should be worried about? should i do something about it?,"humans are social creatures so this can be an alarming thing for a parent to deal with, just like adults children are not the same and some children are more social than others, if he plays alone at recess (all the time) it would worry myself as well, however recess is only one domain of life, does he have friends outside of school or daycare? does he socialize in other situations or is it just at recess where this occurs? if this is a global problem occurring at other social times it may be indicative of something deeper going on, if perhaps it is occurring just during recess it could be something else altogether. i would request reports from all teachers and caregivers concerning socialization and make a choice on whether or not to evaluate further.hope this helps,c"
"my mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. she calls me every day complaining, but i dont want to hear it anymore.","it is understandable that its very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece. you cannot change your mothers feelings and responsibilities, which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness. it must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her. this type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship, living situation, and the feeling of being abandoned. not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need, it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation. nonetheless, it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself. it is likely that your mothers complaints may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support. in this case, you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain, this must be very difficult for you because i hear the stress in your voice almost everyday. its very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed. i feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance. when empathy and understanding is communicated, recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional help.after sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help, the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you. this means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother andor niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed. this could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally, taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite. you could then say to her if she complains again, i cannot change the way you feel in this situation and i encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what i could do is .........(explain what you could do to help)."

ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,"if you have only been to a couple of sessions, it makes sense that you might still feel apprehensive at first. therapy is hard work! you may be talking about some things that you never talked to anyone about before. opening up to stranger can be scary. after you feel comfortable with your counselor, and trust has built up and you feel understood in session, you should feel more relaxed. i would encourage you to talk to your counselor about feeling a little shaky. sharing what the process is like for you is important in your work. if you still feel unsure about sharing after several sessions, it is important to take a look at that and try to understand where that may be coming from. for example, are you and the therapist not a good fit? but, again if you are just starting out in working together, feeling a little bit nervous makes perfect sense, and i encourage you to give it a bit more time and to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling."

im 17 and im sick and tired of going back and forth. id like to stay at my mothers house. this problem has really affected me. ive had anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts and self-harm in the past. currently im going through anxiety and my thearapist is not available. how do i handle this?,"ok first things first. we have to think of your safety and take care of those thoughts of hurting yourself.yes, this is a major problem for you and can cause anxiety and depression. you have the right to be sick and tired. kids often are pawns in this marital problems that their parents have. im sorry that this is happening to you.i am not sure of your rights in the state you live in but as far as i know you as a 17 year old you have the right to stay where you want. so youre going through an anxiety episode and your therapist is not available. if im the therapist we would have already set up a plan so that if you are in this situation you would know what to do. in the worst case scenario you would be able to contact me.but i would have given you several exercises to help reduce your anxiety.staying with your mom should be your choice. i know you probably dont want to hurt anyones feelings but there are ways to ease the tension. maybe with your permission and their agreement, we all could meet together for a session or two to ease your tensions and get over and through this hassle."

i am pretty sure i have depression and anxiety. i also have voices in my head. i have problems sleeping too. ive already been diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. i have self-harmed in the last and used to be suicidal. how do i tell them this and ask for therapy?,"if you have already been diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, can you go back to the people who diagnosed you with those things?it may be that your parents would be open to you talking with someone because it sounds like you have done this in the past. i dont know whether you have a specific reason that you are thinking they may have some hesitation, but if you are comfortable saying that you would really like to talk to someone because you are feeling sad or anxious (or whichever of your concerns you feel comfortable revealing to them), that may be a way to start the process. as for how you tell them about the fact that you have harmed yourself in the past and used to be suicidal, a therapist may be able to work together with you to discuss the best way to tell them about that.im not sure if you have told anyone about what you have been experiencing, but if you have some support there, perhaps they would be able to give you feedback about ways to talk with your parents as well.you mentioned that sometimes you hear voices. this can happen for a variety of reasons, but if the voices that you hear are giving you directions and you feel as though you might follow them, that would be a time to ask for immediate help, before you follow through with what they are telling you, perhaps by calling 800-273-8255. they may be able to connect you with local resources and they can definitely talk with you in the moment that you call."
"i have been falling into a deep depression where i can no function during the day and night. the only time i am at peace is when im asleep. if i am with friends, family, at work, and mainly alone, i cannot think straight. i no longer feel like myself.","i dont know how long ago your breakup was, but i would suggest that you reach out to friends or family that you trust and perhaps a local mental health clinician.im not sure what you mean when you say that you are not able to function during the day and night. if you are having trouble sleeping for more than a few nights, consider talking with your primary care physician. not sleeping can really make changes in your emotions seem much larger.can you find anything in your life that is the same as it was before the breakup? this may be a starting point for you. i wonder if you could think of and moment or two each day when you feel emotionally at peace while you are awake. also consider looking at things that you can control, such as when you choose to wear, eat, and who you talk to about your deepest feelings.you mentioned that you have friends and family. i wonder if any of them are supportive to you.please reach out and talk to someone about the details. i get the sense that you feel that you are alone in this, and having someone there to help you sort out what youre feeling sounds like it would be a gift to yourself."

"my boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up. weve since gotten back together and are trying to make it work. i dont know how to trust him now, but i really want to make it work, and it seems like he does too. but my trust issues are getting in the way and causing problems.","hi michigan,this is a common issue. how do you trust after you know someone is capable of hurting you? i totally get that its hard, and i believe its worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone. you can be stronger in the scarred places. i would suggest that you each have a separate job to do to rebuild this trust. it is definitely possible to rebuild it, because anything is possible if both people want it enough.your boyfriend came clean to you...this is pretty crucial. he chose to honour your needs rather than keep the secret. you can use that as evidence in your proof that he loves me file. work on that file...thicken it up. having a thick he does care about me and wouldnt hurt me again file will help you. other things that he can do to help you thicken that file (because after all, his behaviours caused this problem): answer all your questions, dont brush you off if youre feeling insecure, treat you as though youre a priority, avoid questionable contact with other women, have open communication, give you passwords to devices so there is transparency. he can help you to understand where those behaviours came from...why he cheated in the first places (although people arent always good with those why questions!)you can focus on telling yourself that people change, that he deserves a chance to show you he can be loyal (or at least youve decided to give him that chance), and that you want to be a trusting person. if you act like a trusting person, you will likely feel more like one. dont go snooping, dont interrogate him. its normal you might feel scared and try to tell him that when you do. let him know what happens that leads to you feeling scared.this is a start for you. a good therapist can be helpful too!"

im feeling really overwhelmed with my workload.,"work-related stress can be difficult to manage, but there are ways to reduce your workload and manage your stress. lets talk about your experiences and explore strategies for better time management and work-life balance."
were in an eight year relationship. my boyfriend drinks a lot. he experienced childhood trauma. i dont know how to deal with violent outbursts.,"first, let me extend my compassion to both of you -- it sounds like you have a lot on your plates. childhood trauma carries its negative effects into our adulthood and affects everyone who loves us. your question is brief, so ill just try to give general answers as best i can. from my experiences treating many people with your boyfriends experiences, the short, healthy answer is that you cant fix the situation and maybe not even be able to help. he needs a professional. period. what you can do, is take care of yourself. with his background, it is not likely that he will be able to help you or take care of you in a healthy way. your task needs to prioritize your own safety and well-being. trauma and substance abuse are the definition of being out of control, unable to set and manage appropriate boundaries, manage his own emotions and behaviors. so your boyfriend is unlikely to be able to change in the near-term, certainly not without professional help. you might also benefit from help and support, to understand your own role in your relationship and how you can make changes in your life. i am not blaming you for any aspect of your boyfriends behavior, only acknowledging that there are two people in every relationship. if you have accepted your boyfriends drinking and violent outbursts in the past (by staying in the relationship), that is likely to perpetuate his behavior. and there isnt any way to handle violent outbursts. they shouldnt be handled at all, and if you have to be away from your boyfriend during his outbursts in order to be emotionally and physically safe, then that may be what you will have to do. we can never really change anyone else. the only person we can change is ourselves. sometimes our behavior changes the odds of another persons behaviors, but it doesnt control it. i would recommend that you work with a professional to first, ensure your own safety above all. then make decisions about what behavior you are willing to accept or be connected to, and which you want to separate from. whatever your boyfriend does in his life, you will be happier if you manage your own feelings, set boundaries, etc. let me say again that you also would benefit from some good insight and support as you continue your journey. wishing you and your boyfriend healing and recovery."

"i just got married with my husband. i have four kids of my own, and he accepts me with my kids. i am thankful he loves my kids even though theyre not his. now we are having problems in our relationship because of my past. i know all marriages have problems, but sometimes i feel its not going to work out if theres no trust. its hard for me to let go because i love him, but i am getting tired.","hi louisiana,you say that the problems are with your past, but my hunch is the problems are about his insecurity and his personal barriers to trust (unless youve recently revealed details of a sordid past?). you dont mention ever having hurt the trust in the relationship.trust is the first stage in a relationship. moving forward before they develop trust is a common mistake couples make, and now you two have involved children in a relationship thats missing a crucial element. but you didnt see this coming, did you? thats because only as we become emotionally intimate do our deeper fears and insecurities come to the surface. i give you credit for wanting it to work, and i believe you would benefit from the support of a therapist in working through the kinks related to trust. good luck!"
im having trouble in my relationship and i dont know what to do.,lets explore what might be causing the issues in your relationship and work on developing communication and problem-solving skills to improve it. we can also discuss couples therapy options.
weve been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years. i recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a female coworker. i dont know how to approach this situation. how do i ask him about it?.,"i agree with sherry that in a close intimate relationship, you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others. these questions help couples to build connection and trust. its based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason (support, openess, understanding, empathy), you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive. how he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him. if your partner responds in an open and understanding manner, it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance. if he responds in a defensive manner, it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide. either way, you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that. if he continues to be defensive or evasive, then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actions.dr. virginia cho"
"sometimes, im fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. ive always thought it was normal and i was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself.","your, sitting in your car for 30 minutes, story sounds so sad and frustrating.yes, youre describing classic symptoms of anxiety.anxiety itself is the indirect result of repeatedly being in positions of feeling helpless or frightened.are you able to recall from your growing up years of feeling insecure?you may not have felt loved and nurtured as much as you needed.some people develop anxiety from missing enough love. they feel lacking in ability to take care of themselves, similar to the lack of being sufficiently taken care of when younger.try understanding if you felt neglected emotionally.if yes, then start the slow process of emotionally rewarding and acknowledging yourself.progress will be slow.eventually youll stabilize the way you feel toward yourself.this will gradually result in decreased anxiety."
"my mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. she calls me every day complaining, but i dont want to hear it anymore.","it is understandable that its very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece. you cannot change your mothers feelings and responsibilities, which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness. it must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her. this type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship, living situation, and the feeling of being abandoned. not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need, it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation. nonetheless, it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself. it is likely that your mothers complaints may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support. in this case, you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain, this must be very difficult for you because i hear the stress in your voice almost everyday. its very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed. i feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance. when empathy and understanding is communicated, recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional help.after sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help, the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you. this means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother andor niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed. this could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally, taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite. you could then say to her if she complains again, i cannot change the way you feel in this situation and i encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what i could do is .........(explain what you could do to help)."

i dont know what to say. i have never really known who i am.,"the older i get, the more i believe that our real task isnt to find ourselves. were already 100 there. what we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive, most happy, most creative, and most fully engaged with life. it is in those moments that we find ourselves.for example, i couldnt help loving the people or things i loved, no matter who tried to talk me out of them. all i needed to do was notice when my heart opened and i felt the most alive--not because i was afraid or addicted, but because in those moments, i was in contact with my highest self. on the flip side, i needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in me--the ones that made me feel controlled, constricted, dishonest, resentful, or afraid--and be honest about them. mindfulness of what already is is the key to finding yourself. align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you. dont let old habits, crappy jobs, or mean-spirited people define you. just stumble your way forward as best you can, with greater self-awareness followed by affirmative action.."
they discontinued treatment for no apparent reason after they thought to diagnose me with schizophrenia.,"the general rule against medical abandonment says thst whenever healthcare providers discontinue treatment with you when you still need it, they are legally required to make sure that you have access to another provider of equal or higher ability.in this case, if your treatment team decided to discontinue your treatment based on a diagnosis of schizophrenia, they still will likely be required to provide you with a referral to someone who can provide you with treatment. if you havent already done so, id recommend that you explicitly ask for a referral."

weve been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years. i recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a female coworker. i dont know how to approach this situation. how do i ask him about it?.,"just ask him.im not sure how you saw his phone if youre in a long distance relationship, because long distance means you live far apart from each other and dont get to see each other in person. therefore, i think we may have a different understanding of the definition of long distance relationship which makes it hard for me to adequately answer this question for you.i dont know how old you are, but if youre an adult, after two and a half years, i dont think its unreasonable to have an open and honest talk with each other about where the relationship is going and what you both want and expect. long distance relationships are difficult to keep alive because you dont ever see each other in person. talking, texting, and video chatting isnt enough, and the longer the physical distance remains, the more difficult it becomes to keep an emotional closeness. it may be time to evaluate the situation, figure out when (if ever) the two of you will be able to be together in person, and if you can and want to wait that long. do you both want the same things out of life? if one of you wants to take the relationship to the next level but the other doesnt, then it doesnt matter if its long distance or not - if you arent on the same page with the relationship, it is going to be difficult to make it work.trust is important. issues with trust, insecurity, jealousy, lying andor hiding things from each other, being afraid to speak up and have an honest conversation - these things can ruin relationships if not addressed. i know confrontation of any sort can be hard for some people, but it is necessary at times. evaluate your true feelings for him. are you with him for reasons other than love, such as being afraid to be alone or thinking you wouldnt be able to find someone else? has he ever given you reason to be suspicious of his female coworkers or friends before? some people, unfortunately, develop a track record of indiscretions and give their significant others ample reason for distrusting them. however, if this is not the case, you may be unfairly judging his texting through the eyes of your own insecurities. it may be time for you both to take an honest assessment of your own reasons for being in the relationship, figure out what you want, and make a decision. this may result in bringing the two of you closer and taking the relationship to the next level. or, it could lead to a decision to end things. i know that can be difficult, but you both deserve to be happy and to be allowed to make the decisions that will lead to your personal happiness."

"i am a young adult, and i was sexually assaulted by an older man when i was a teenager (which has really intensified the guiltshame). however, ive been attracted to much older men since i was even younger than that.","sometimes the reason for being attracted to older men is because of growing up with a father who was distant.if you grew up having enough interaction with your dad to know youd have liked more and didnt receive this, then maybe your longings of childhood are still active within you.it is ok to like older men.just be sure youre not idealizing them, or anyone else.because regardless of age, a relationship is based on who the two people really are, not how wed like imagining them."

"im feeling rejected and frustrated. this is not new. the first month we were together, sex was about every day. then it slowed down to once a month right away. i love my husband, but i am struggling with this.","have you said anything to your husband about the way youre feeling?start with this.sex is after all, a two person enterprise.if he would like to talk about the way youre feeling, great and wonderful. the two of you already are continuing to grow trust in your communication and relationship.if he doesnt want to talk about how youre feeling, then youre facing a different problemyour feelings are real and need to be handled.if you end up facing your feelings of frustration about your husband not wanting to have sex with you, on your own, then does your husband give you a truthful sounding reason as to why not?ask what explains his disinterest in having sex with you.if he doesnt want to address this question, then you are a little further down the rung of trust and care about you.depending on how satisfied you are with his answers, will guide you on how much dissatisfaction you can live with and why, longterm."
"im a guy. if i dont like girls, nor do i like guys, does that mean im gay?","it doesnt sound like you are finding yourself attracted to anyone. it could mean that you just havent connected with anyone you find attractive, or that you are asexual - essentially not oriented toward anyone. i would suggest doing some reading on asexuality and see if it connects to how you feel!"

i believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content. the father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs. his co-worker sent him an inappropriate video. he got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that.,"in my book, this is a boundary issue. although you do not like inappropriate content, it is not up to you what your childs father looks at or what his friend sends him. it is really hard not to monitor other peoples lives, but in the end, your rights begin and end with you."

my husband cheated on me and it hurt me very bad. it was a time when my health was poor. im have a hard time moving on.,"how has your husband acted since then? was he regretful? how did you find out? did he confess? these are all things that you want to consider. betrayal is very hard to get over so if its taking you awhile to get over, know that this is normal.hopefully youre husband has been very regretful and upfront and honest with you since this happened. it may take awhile to reestablish your trust with him and he should understand this. its also very important to discuss why he cheated. you want to make sure that the reasoning behind this was not something that could arise again in the future. and if it can, there needs to be an action plan in place (i.e. being honest with how hes feeling) so that you both get a chance to rectify the situation.if the cheating has happened more than once, you may want to reevaluate your reasoning for staying in the marriage. it would be obvious that he did not truly regret what he had done or else he wouldnt repeat the same mistake. however, if it was a single event and he has shown you and continuously shows you that he genuinely loves you and is sorry for his mistake, i would give it a try. people do make mistakes and sometimes it takes an event like this to realize what you have.know that it takes time and that you have the right to feel what you feel. if the relationship was a good, healthy relationship, it is worth saving. ease back into it and be upfront with your feelings. in return, your husband should be patient and understanding of this. also, marriage counselors are often a good go-to as they have a great deal of experience working with marriages in similar situations. best of luck to you!"

"my mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. she calls me every day complaining, but i dont want to hear it anymore.","sounds like it is time to set some boundaries with your mom. you can do this by letting her know that you understand how she is feeling and you understand that she is under a tremendous amount of stress. validate her feelings and words. after you do that, tell her how hearing about it daily is affecting you let. let her know that it is hard for you to hear how stressed she is, how hard it is you to have these daily calls. let her know that you are feeling stressed about her own well being. you can then suggest that she find a therapist to speak to about how she is feeling and what she is going through. i suggest writing out what you want to say, before you say it. practice saying it a few times so that it flows naturally when you do have the conversation with her.also, when you start setting boundaries with people they dont usually like it. they give some sort of push back either by expressing disappointment or anger towards you. this has nothing to do with you. this is them having a hard time hearing and accepting the boundary you are setting. the other thing people tend to do when you set a boundary is to test it. in this situation it might look like your mom calling you the next day as if the two of you never had the conversation. in this situation it falls on you to set the boundary again, by having the same conversation again with her. over time she will accept the boundary and she will be ok with it."

i dont understand why this is happening. why do i feel this way?,"the first step to answer your question is to reflect on what is going on in your life overall. if youre in the midst of severe stress, whether within your relationship or effort to establish a relationship, upheaval in family dynamics, some type of significant loss like a job or someone with whom you feel closely attached, then you may simply be creating the solitude which is necessary to better understand and absorb the meaning of these changes.i assume you mean you are by yourself when you are indoors.what you write sounds like youre not happy with this recent urge rather than that you and someone or others are having great and fun times together.one way to encourage yourself to go back outdoors is to connect w a friend or search for an interest within you to develop.this way with either of these, youd feel a little bit of motivation to join and get more involved with either of these."

"my husband and i have been together for seven years now. i will be honest: i have a problem lying to him about stupid stuff. i recently stupidly lied to my husband about an accident because i was afraid to tell him what happened. ever since then, he gives me the cold shoulder. he gets so mad and ignores me for days. hes really verbally and emotionally abusive. he tells me all the bad things about me and calls me awful names. should we call it quits? im tired of crying, but we have a toddler together.","hi texas, thanks for your honesty it helps me know where to go in answering you. what strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtfulabusivecontrolling with you, and then you ask should we call it quits?. we? i wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours, rather than yours together. the way your husband treats you is not your fault, texas. your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you. the problem is not your lying. the problem is that you dont feel safe enough to be honest with a person youre supposed to be able to trust.theres an analogy that i sometimes use i dont know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story, but its powerful either way, so i will tell it to you.if you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water, the frog will jump out immediately, knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot, it will die. if you take a frog, however, and put it in a pot of cold water, and slowly, slowly, heat it to boiling, the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot by the time it realises its dying, it has lost its strength. its called learned helplessness. when your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time, you get used to that, and you fail to see the options that are available to you. you have a toddler, and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child. in my experience, and what research backs up, is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy. you are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abuse. this is a complex picture, and if you were my client, i would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where youre seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions, but i do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child. i sincerely hope you seek professional help, with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist. i wish you the best."

"i have been pushing people away all my life. i finally have a great boyfriend who loves me, but i keep pushing him away and i dont want to. i need to learn to open up.","figuring out the space we need between ourselves and others is an ongoing and unsolvable task. but it sounds like you may be feeling stuck in a pattern of pushing people away and are wanting to change that. pushing others away may be your way of surviving relationships and may have proven to be very helpful at one point in your life. or it may be serving some other purpose. one helpful way to consider changing that is to seek out a therapist. psychotherapy can provide you with a relationship that is in tune to you and that can provide the reflection and supportive challenges to help determine the function the pushing away is serving. it also may be helpful for you to take time to reflect on the moments when interpersonal guardedness snuck its way into the interaction. what were you feeling right before this? did it provide relief? reflecting on what was happening just before and right after can provide some clues as to what purpose the pushing away serves.it may be helpful to communicate to the boyfriend how you experience intimacy and the discomfort it can bring you at times. this may help him be as sensitive as you need him to be about the pace of the relationship, and to understand what may be happening when you push him away."

ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,"it can be uncomfortable talking to someone about your life in the great detail that is normally necessary for counseling to be beneficial. since youre already going to counseling, congratulations on taking that big, first, stress-inducing step. hopefully by now you are starting to feel a little more comfortable with your therapist. it can be helpful to address this big elephant in the room and talk to your therapist about this. i do my best to help people feel comfortable when they come to counseling, but regardless of how hard we try, sometimes it is just a little hard to get accustomed to. the good news is, the more you keep at it, the more normal it will become."

"how do i ever trust another woman? i have found myself constantly reading between the lines with every other woman that i meet. i am having a difficult time making any sort of connection to anyone because of her deception and willingness to say and do literally anything in order to control my emotions. once the relationship was over, she became extremely abusive and has attempted to intimidate me into silence regarding the many false claims made on her immigration application.","im sorry to hear about that situation. if the woman was your therapist (or had been at one time), this could represent a significant ethical violation when she created a dual relationship with you.even if you were not her client, this might still be an ethical violation. counselors are held to a high standard of conduct and honesty at all times.in a situation like this you might consider filing a complaint with the state regulatory board."

"i have been experiencing a lot of sexual tension with a lot of the guys that i talk to nowadays. i keep imagining having sex with them. i have never had sex before, nor have i had a boyfriend. i feel lonely and empty. i feel like my body is not okay, and i am missing something. i talk to so many boys in school, and i always fantasize about half of them. i want this feeling to stop because it is interfering with my time to study since most of the time, i am busy thinking about sex.","hi montreal, im glad you wrote. what youre experiencing is normal. were sexual beings. we have a built-in desire to connect sexually with others, because it feels good, to keep procreation going, and mostly to connect with other people, because connecting with others makes us feel fulfilled and valuable. sexual desire is a healthy part of you. maybe your body is telling you it wants to dive into that water and taste it instead of just staring at it? it sounds like youre beginning to explore yourself sexually, and thats okay.at your young age, you also have another innate burning desire, and that is to know yourself. i see both of these desires burning and competing in you. its a bit of a crazy time...you want to connect with others but youre not sure who you are or what you want from them. you want to know yourself but you cant learn about yourself in a vacuum. its okay to trust your instincts. its okay to connect sexually with others, as long as youre preventing disease and pregnancy and you know how to protect your boundaries. but even as i write this, i think maybe im being controlling and overprotective of you its your body and youre in charge of what happens to it! (but i do want you to be safe...whatever that means to you). maybe talk to someone you trust. with each encounter you have with other people (sexual or not), you will learn more about yourself and what you want, both sexually and just in relationship or friendship. you will develop a sense of who you are.have you tried to get to know yourself sexually? this is a super place to start, and knowing how your own body works can give you confidence when you eventually connect with others. when you explore your own body, what feels good? what brings you to orgasm? i wish you well as you explore both who you are and how it feels to connect with others safely. :)"

"i know im ruining my life with a lot of the decisions i make. i consistently tell myself i need to make some serious changes in my life, but i just cant seem to even though i really want to. why cant i force myself to change?","in general the reason people arent able to change is because the person feels a sense of fear to change.what the roots are of this fear are usually easiest to identify by talking with someone whom you trust and feel safe to talk about your inner thoughts and emotions.if you havent got someone like this in your life, which is common, then shop around for a therapist because a therapist is someone who is professionally trained to listen in a way which helps someone know more about who they are.be patient with yourself too. change sometimes feels much scarier and is more complex than simple compared with whatever you would like to change."

"ive always thought that there wasnt much good out there for me. now that things are actually going well, it kind of scares me. i spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured i would be alone. i recently met a great woman who seems to really like me, and i dont know how to process this. its bothering both of us.","this can be really anxiety-producing when you have not felt it before. it may be helpful to work through some of this with a local therapist so you can get more specific ideas.some other things that come to my mind are maybe talking about spending about 10 minutes or so discussing how you are feeling and seeing if your partner is willing to listen. then you could ask questions about how she would react if you were doing something she did not like. this allows you to react to information she is actually giving you rather than your perceptions that sound like they are different than what she is trying to tell you. this gives you the power to receive the messages that she is sending to you.i would also wonder where you have learned that there wasnt much good out there for you and how you can stay present in the moment when you are with your girlfriend and see that she wants to be there with you. perhaps you could look at what makes you feel emotionally safe and trusting with her and focus on that. you could even remind yourself okay, im here with name of girlfriend and this is okay when im with her.we all have different levels of defenses in situations in which different people. its common for people to see these things as black and white (either totally open or very self-protective. in reality, its much more like a rainbow and the different shades of color that are available in the rainbow spectrum of white light (its not really just red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet that we all know, but an infinite spectrum of shades of colors that fade from one into the next). you can change your level of defensiveness with your girlfriend depending upon the location you are in, the mood you are both in, the subject, etc. there are infinite numbers of choices and you can experiment.another thing that could help is to communicate about communication. if one of you uses a phrase that triggers something from earlier in your life or is really uncomfortable, you could discuss that. if she says certain things that make you feel really comfortable, you could discuss that as well.hopefully you can learn more about yourselves and each other at the same time."

"im in a relationship with my childs father. im a really jealous person. we dont go out or do anything with other people because of me. to keep our relationship going, i know i have to stop being jealous, but i cant. how can i get over these issues?","it may be important to look at this as getting through something rather than getting over it. if youre aware of the reasons why you are jealous, i dont know if they relate to this relationship or a previous one, but you could remind yourself of the differences if your feelings of jealousy relate to something from your past.also, it may be beneficial to have a conversation with your childs father if you are both open to having a discussion about this in a way that you summarize what each other is saying so you are sure that you are understanding each other, at least to some degree.also, consider what you may want from your childs father to assist you with this. you cannot make him do anything to support you with this, but you can certainly ask.what is something you could start or stop doing to move you toward your goal?"
"maybe this is a stupid question, but i sometimes dont know whats real or not. if feel at times like everyones lying. how do i know if god is one of those lies?","there are an infinite number of ways to look at this. spirituality, religion, god, higher power, and many other parts of this discussion mean different things to different people. my question for you is what does real actually mean to you? often, the concept of god has to do with what you believe in. if you ask 1000 different people, youll probably get almost that many different answers.consider talking with friends or family about this. i would suggest, though, that you have the discussion initially with people who you trust and who you feel are willing to listen to your questions and beliefs and perhaps offer an opinion without trying to make you believe as they do. you may also consider speaking with a pastor or another religious figure. the local salvation army may have a link to a religious or spiritual person that leads nondenominational church services. there may be able to help you to sort through this if your friends and family do not provide a comfortable environment for you related to this discussion.just a word of caution. in my experience, ideas of religion and spirituality can be lead to very deep discussions with some people who are very strongly connected to what they believe. some people do not easily separate their own beliefs from those of others. when initiating conversations about this, try first asking whether someone would be comfortable discussing religion or spirituality. a second question may be whether it is okay with this person you are talking to if you have different beliefs or opinions.as far as whether god is real or not, consider trusting yourself and what you learn, feel, and believe as you work through this process."
"after he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. now he is depressed and hopeless again.","since as husband and wife your lives are closely joined, how your husband feels greatly influences the way you feel.give yourself some time to concentrate on how youve been affected by your husbands suicide attempt. even if you decide against immediately telling him how youre feeling, knowing this about yourself will guide how and the topics you bring up with him.is your husband talking easily with you?do you have some ideas as to what is creating his feeling of hopelessness?the ideal approach would be if the two of you are able to discuss what bothers him and what bothers you.depending on how far away you each are from such a position, you may benefit from speaking with a licensed professional therapist who can guide you and or you and your husband on opening up for discussion what feels stressful enough to merit taking ones own life."
im going through a breakup and am having a really hard time coping with the situation. what can i do?,"give yourself time to grieve and process your emotions. consider talking to a therapist or a trusted friend to help you navigate the situation. engage in self-care practices, such as exercise or meditation, and try to stay busy with hobbies and activities that you enjoy."
"is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?",crying is clearing. it is a release of energy and toxins. crying is a good thing and a great way to let go and move forward!
"my husband doesnt trust me for some past we had. i know all marriages have their ups and downs, but sometimes, i feel i am getting tired of the same thing over and over: that i am messing around, which i am not.","im sorry to hear about the trust issues in your relationship. trust, as you clearly know, is essential to healthy relationships. past indiscretions or dishonesty can damage this trust and make it really hard to confidence that these things will not happen again despite reassurances. we tend to be very sensitive to betrayal and risks to our relationship security. rebuilding trust takes time and effort for both parties. on your end, you may need to provide more reassurance and more concrete evidence that you are trustworthy, gestures of transparency (e.g. - giving him more information about where you are going and who you will be with, letting him know when you get texts or emails from people that might give him pause or trigger insecurities), and more patience and empathy for his fears. on his end, he may need to learn to be with his insecurities and fears and ask for reassurance about your love and commitment in ways that do not lead to criticizing you, attempting to control you, or limiting your freedom. if you are not able to come to agreements about how to put his fears to rest without it negatively impacting your life, i would suggest getting some professional help from a marriage counsellor or couples therapist."
im struggling with depression and feel like nothing brings me joy anymore. what can i do to feel better?,"depression can make it difficult to feel pleasure or motivation. its important to seek professional help and consider therapy or medication. in addition, try to engage in activities that used to bring you pleasure, even if you dont feel like it. exercise, spending time in nature, practicing mindfulness, and connecting with loved ones can all help improve mood. make sure to also take care of your physical health by getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and avoiding drugs and alcohol."

"im in my early 20s. ive been married once, and he cheated on me. ever since then, ive felt ugly no matter what. im engaged, and i still feel ugly. i dont like to take pictures of myself.","sounds as though youre taking the blame for the bad actions of your former husband.he did an ugly action, and instead of feeling only your own emotions in response to being cheated on, you are holding his ugly behavior within you and feeling it.does this sound like a possible explanation of why your feeling of ugliness started after the cheating incident?you may start feeling better by looking within your own heart for the full effects of having been hurt. it is possible there is more suffering within you than youve realized until now.as you address all the emotional pain youve lived through, the feeling of ugliness may drop out all of its own. because youd be focused on you, not on any of the ugliness introduced into your life by your cheating ex husband."
im struggling with low self-esteem and feel like im not good enough. what can i do to improve my self-worth?,"low self-esteem is a common issue, and there are many ways to improve your self-worth. one approach is cognitive-behavioral therapy, which can help you identify and challenge negative thoughts and behaviors that contribute to low self-esteem. additionally, practicing self-care, engaging in activities that bring you joy, and surrounding yourself with positive and supportive people can all be helpful."
"i was the one who ended it, and im so glad i did. it was the best decision i made in my life. but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks? it is creating a wall in my current relationship.","ending an abusive relationship is often very difficult, especially if you were very close initially without the presence of abuse. if the abuse included verbal or psychological condemnation, you will often have a negative self-image that you may know is not true but often feels very true. this negative self-image and fear of being abused again can activate protections in you that were needed at the time you were abused but now create a wall in your current relationship. the fact that you were able to end the relationship and know that you made the right decision is a great acknowledgement that you have solid internal resources to draw upon in healing from the abuse. good for you!nightmares and flashbacks are a strong sign of memories, including associated beliefs, emotions, and physical sensations, that have remained unprocessed and therefore unhealed. there are likely reminders (called triggers) of the past abuse that are being activated in your current relationship that are allowing these unhealed memories to come to the surface and affect both your sleep and your waking experiences. this is certainly not something you are purposefully doing but is the result of what happened to you. however, you likely feel as if you are not in control. the goal is protect your current relationship, evaluate your self-image for flaws in beliefs and feelings, and begin working on healing your memories of abuse. in many cases, my use of emdr (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) would be helpful in reducing the emotional strength of your abuse memories, reduce or eliminate triggers, bring healing, and allow you to enjoy being in the present with your current relationship. i would recommend discussing with your current partner your harmful past experiences, your decision to pursue counseling, and your strong desire to be healthy for your current relationship. with a good support network in place, healing is very possible."
im having trouble with my identity and dont feel like i fit in anywhere.,"its important to explore and understand your own identity. lets work on identifying personal values and beliefs, and developing a sense of self that feels authentic and fulfilling. we can also discuss potential support groups or communities that may align with your identity and provide a sense of belonging."

he is in his late thirties and i am in my mid twenties. we have been together for about 5 months. i really like him. he says he cares about me and is willing to fight to make things right. he has been very apologetic and expressed he did it out of fear. i dont know if its worth giving him a second chance.,"cheating is often a sign that something is amiss in the relationship. his fear may be full of information. while its possible to repair relationships after a betrayal its also challenging to do, especially so early in your relationship. i cant tell you if you shouldshouldnt give this relationship a second chance but i will tell you to tune into your own intuition (and follow your own fears in doing so, they often are incredibly informative when we dont push them away with denial)."

i need help dealing with stress. how can i handle it all and feel less stressed out?,"there are many causes for feeling stressed out. between a demanding job, family responsibilities, and everything else that can come up, stress becomes more and more part of our everyday life. one of the best ways to combat the toxic effects of stress on our bodies, social lives, and overall well being is to engage in self-care. but not the self-care that most people think of like vacations or massages. the best self-care is the kind that helps you live the life that you already have rather than escape it. you see, the reason why vacations and massages dont work long term in reducing stress is that they allow you to escape from what is causing the stress without truly fixing it so you just return to what already stressed you out. so, instead you need to find ways to help live with the stressors that you already have. they can be things like creating a more manageable schedule, introducing healthy eating or exercising, financial planning, and even learning a few simple relaxation skills. the key to combatting stress is to make small but consistent changes to your life so that it becomes more manageable and more enjoyable."

"im planning to have baby, so i have to quit smoking - but its hard. sometimes its not a physical need, its mental. i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. what can i do to get rid of this addiction?","quitting smoking can be difficult. its also true that there is part that is sometimes a physical need and a part that is often connected to emotions in some way. from the way that you wrote this, it sounds like you may have been able to stop smoking physically, but still have cravings.one thing you can do is talk with your primary care physician or obgyn about whether there is anything that you can take to help with the cravings. sometimes that can very helpful.as far as the more emotional or mental piece, these things come to mind:sometimes a crucial part is looking at the habit of smoking and seeing what else you can do to keep your mind and hands busy. there are sometimes toys, like those available at office playground, that may help to keep you physically occupied.there can also be changes or additions to your routine because i imagine that smoking took up a great deal of your time. maybe when you have the temptation to get up and go to have a cigarette, you could have several other things that you can get up and do instead. the list is endless, but a few examples could be doing some physical exercise (with the permission of your doctor) just for a couple minutes because that could help with the craving as well, completing a puzzle, learning a new activity that requires using your hands (painting or knitting, perhaps).another piece of quitting smoking is often linked to anxiety or other emotional changes, perhaps irritability. depending on what it is that you may be feeling, learning other strategies to use can be helpful as well.this can all be quite overwhelming and a very big life change. i would recommend that if things do not become easier for you, consider talking with a therapist. then you could not only have some more strategies or ideas directly related to you, but you could have very direct support for what you are trying to do.i give you a lot of credit!"
i am in my early 20s and i still live with my parents because i cant afford to live alone. my mother says that if i live under her roof i have to follow her rules. she is trying to control my life. what should i do?,"hello. even though legally you are an adult, it is a matter of courtesy to respect the homes of your parents. as long as you live there, you should be considerate of their needs. at the same time, there should be conversation about what each of you considers appropriate as it pertains to communication between a parent and an adult (even though you are still her offspring). this will require openness, honesty, and a willingness to give from both sides in a respectful way. healthy boundaries can be established and honored when each is willing to do their part in this new relationship. your mother knows you are an adult, but has not had as many years of treating you like one. so mentally and emotionally this will take some time for her to adapt. share your concerns with her, and see if you can come up with a set of rules that you both can honor. it will be a great stepping stone for both of you as you move into this new chapter together as you begin relating a little differently.reach out for help to a counselor if needed. you dont have to sort this out on your own. and lastly, take good care of yourself in the process. you are moving through some exciting times in your life. the more you can have support as you explore new events, the better you might feel less stressed.warm regards."
"i have a lot on my mind, but all i want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone. why do i feel so alone?","it has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal. often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue. for some, depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated, they discover that they are anxious (worried) about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief. when there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts (either in their mind or in practical application) to resolve the anxiety, depression is often the result. in this type of case, depression is not the main or underlying issue. the anxiety is the underlying issue. having a lot on my mind sounds like anxiety. unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with emptiness. in the question above, i would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having a lot on my mind and determine where these might be coming from. has there been ongoing rejection from peers? from family? if so, why does this seem to be happening? isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain. where does that need to protect originate? are there unmet needs from childhood? are there traumatic life events that have created a need to self-protect as a defense mechanism? we can feel alone even when in a crow of people or at a party. this has nothing, in this case, to do with being around people. it has more to do with how we view ourselves. if there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says, you are worth nothing or you dont deserve the company of others then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it. i would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time. the developmental needs meeting strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs. if there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people, then emdr can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma. looking at whether this individuals issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy."

"my husband doesnt trust me for some past we had. i know all marriages have their ups and downs, but sometimes, i feel i am getting tired of the same thing over and over: that i am messing around, which i am not.","hi louisiana,its normal when trust has been broken in the past for fear and insecurities to come up from time to time. his reactions may not mean that he doesnt trust you, but rather that he gets scared that hes going to be hurt again. youre a bit vague about the past. you dont say whether you cheated or not. if you did, then you might try taking an approach where you a) take responsibility for your past actions, b) show an understanding of and compassion for his pain about that, c) do everything you can to demonstrate trust and show that he is your priority, and d) reassure him when he says hes scared or feeling insecure. im suggesting that part of healing is you having tolerance of his emotions and demonstrating that youre so confident you can be faithful that you can handle his moments of fear. this is what he and the marriage need in order to heal from the attachment injury.part of the issue might be that when he brings it up, hes coming across as angry, accusing or suspicious, rather than scared and insecure. this often happens. a therapist can help both of you understand that fear is behind the anger, and it works best if he shows you his vulnerable emotions rather than the anger (which is also natural, but less helpful in those moments), and then you can more easily recognise the cue for you to reassure him. as much as you want to forget about it, he might need to talk about it sometimes, and thats normal. his needs are important. also important, however, is your need for respect. if he approaches it in a disrespectful way, thats a separate problem. if its brought up as a weapon, used to shut you down, or used to control or punish, those are unhealthy ways of dealing with past hurts. you can both offer compassion to him and use your sense of boundaries to protect yourself from being flogged with the past.a qualified therapist can help you sort through this trick territory. best of luck."

"over a year ago i had a female friend. she turned out to be kind of crazy so i decided to stop talking to her. when she would call me i wouldnt answer the phone. this made my girlfriend really suspicious. she would ask me why i wouldnt ever answer that phone number. i told my girlfriend that i dont want to be friends with that other woman, but i dont think she believes me. how can i get my girlfriend to understand?","we women really do tend to struggle with the comparison game. and hollywood culture hasnt helped with romantic comedies and song lyrics telling us that when a man appears evasive, theres something to worry about. its been my clinical experience though that most women value transparency and security in their relationships. so you might try sharing a little bit more about your history with this woman. for example:where did you meet her?how long were you friends before you decided to call it quits? why dont you want to be friends with her (i.e., what do you mean by kind of crazy)? i promise this tends to matter to women.were you ever intimately involved with or even attracted to her?if your girlfriend can truly see that you view her as the filet mignon to the other womans hamburger, and that she is your favorite person on the planet and has nothing to worry about, she may start to come around.now, if shes more concerned that you might be taking this womans calls behind your back, while im not typically a huge fan of sharing passwords or phone records, you might print them off and highlight this females number and show your girlfriend that you absolutely are telling the truth.and if you really want to step it up, i would be intentional about doing all the little things that you know your girlfriend loves that helped make her fall in love with you in the first place (e.g., little love notes for her to find or sweet text messages, buy a rose or her favorite flower, have her car detailed, do the laundry...date nights...you get the idea). bottom line - show your girlfriend why out of all the women on the planet that you could be with, you chose her. and would continue to do so all over again. and why you love her as a person. this will help her trust what youre saying. best of luck to you! tamara powell, lmhc"

"im a teenager, and i know the importance of my upcoming schooling. however, no matter how much i put in my best effort, my family thinks i have done zero effort in total. what can i do?","first of all, im glad that you posted here and im glad that you recognize the importance of schooling.where does your family get the idea that you are not putting in the effort? while people can interpret effort differently, with talking about schoolwork, i would think that your grades would show the effort that you are putting in.if you are getting good grades and you are saying that your family does not think your grades are good enough, maybe there could be a conversation where you are able to ask them what they are expecting from you (and try to listen without defending yourself for a few minutes) and then you could explain what you are doing to prepare. maybe you could set time limits so you each have five minutes to discuss this (or less, if you think that would be better).if your grades are not as good as you would like and you are putting in the effort, i would still consider having a conversation like i mentioned above, and perhaps taking advantage of tutoring or other possibilities offered by your school.just as a bit more information for you, i have been working with children, teenagers, and adults for more than nine years now. when someone tells me that they wish their child would do better in school, i always ask what that means. sometimes it means that their grades are ds and fs. for other families, it means that the grades dropped below 95 and in that family, that is unacceptable. perception makes a big difference here.if you are doing your best and accomplishing your goals, that is worth celebrating."

i have a friend that who i used to be in a relationship with. it was brief and turned into us being just good friends. i spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. was i wrong?,"the most important thing to ask yourself here is, how did this action affect my relationship, and is it worth the consequences? regardless of your intentions in this action, your boyfriend is uncomfortable with this type of behavior. from here, we can objectively decide if spending time with your previous partner (because that is likely what your boyfriend sees them as) is worth harming the relationship you currently have. it is very rare that a person would be comfortable with their partner spending more than a very little amount of time with their exes. many times, it just gives the wrong impressions. it is very possible that your partner may believe that since you spend so much time with them, that they are still a contender for the most intimate relationship you have to offer, and truth be told, they kind of are. the best intimate relationships, are friendships first and foremost. it is also a good thing to consider what you are getting out of the relationship with your ex that you are not getting out of the relationship with your current boyfriend. if you go to this person for emotional support before your boyfriend, then it is very likely youre involved in some emotional infidelity. when we turn to others instead of our partner, it is as if we ran into another persons arms instead of theirs. no matter who you are, that hurts."

ive recently thought that i could be transgender but ive never had the mind of a girl.,"hello frostproof,thinking about becoming transgender and being transgender are slightly different. this is a topic that is best discussed with a therapist that specializes in lgbtq issues. from what you have written it sounds as if you still have some confusion as to where you fit in with the labeling

"we have been together over a year. we spend time together every day no matter how busy. he started to be unusually fatigued and losing weight. he also began to be distant and sexually selfish. we had a argument, and he confided he has late stage stomach cancer. he wont treat it.","hello, and thank you for your question. i am very sorry about this life-altering situation that both you and your boyfriend are going through. to be sure, this is a devastating and lonely road for both of you. i say lonely because when things like this happen we often dont know what to say to each other, and so we suffer in silence with little support.here are a few thoughts that i am having, and perhaps others will add things, too:1. by the sound of your main question, it seems like you have every intention to be there for your boyfriend during this difficult time. i am not sure if he is willing to talk about his health situation, but letting him know that you want to support him and also need his support may be helpful. 2. if it is possible, see if he would be willing to go to a counselor with you. there are many things that a counselor could focus on that may help your relationship, but also help you both cope with what is happening.3. if he refuses to seek support, you may want to consider going on your own. if you cant afford it, sometimes hospice organizations offer support groups and other services. it is very important not to neglect yourself. be well,robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc"

"he said he would try and he never did. its been nine months, and this is making me worse. today, he said i have to respect whatever decision he makes. is that true? am i supposed to respect the decision to leave because he cant handle what im going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night? hes constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out.","if your husband is changing his mind about whether or not he wants to stay in the relationship, i wonder if you both might benefit from seeing a therapist who specializes in couples. in my training working with couples, partners come into counseling with one of three goals in mind: strengthening the relationship, getting a divorce, or making a decision. the decision could be whether or not stay together or it could be any number of other things, such as what state to live in.when you ask whether you have to respect whatever decision he makes, respecting his decision does not mean that you have to agree with what he decides. while you do not have the power to change his decision, he also does not have the power to change yours or how you feel about it. having said that, if he is changing his mind a lot, chances are that the only decision he has made is that he needs to make a decision. weighing the options of an important decision (any type of important decision) can be anxiety-producing its own right.the fact that you said you were diagnosed with severe depression leads me to believe that you are already seeing a therapist. perhaps he or she can assist you in navigating through this. im wondering how you feel when you are around your husband. im not sure whether you are saying that having him there is a source of comfort for you or that it leads you to feel more sad. maybe it is a little bit of both."

i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit. i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. i was very embarrassed.,"i also want to note that we, as a society, are especially judgemental about how women dress and present themselves. i am sorry that this boy said something insensitive. there is nothing shameful about your body and it was not your intention to display everything. it also wasnt his place to judge you. as women we are expected to be sexy in some situations and demure in others. men dont have the same range of societal expectations to navigate. you didnt deserve his rudeness."
there are issues from my past that have me very heavily burdened in my heart. ive been torn for so many years and i need help so i can move on with my life. i experienced trauma when i was 8 years old and i did come out about it until i was 40. now i know this is whats holding me back on my happiness. ive met a very loving and caring man but because im holding on to these things from my past im pushing him away. how can i get my life back?,"you already are doing that! you are reaching out (virtually still counts!). you are accepting your past, you are not denying what happened to you, you are talking about the past. you are already doing a great job of starting this journey. you get your life back by doing things differently.i would think about how you would like to process your past. do you want to talk to someone? do you want to write about it? do you want to pray about it? do you want to read and research books about trauma? take some time and think about what you want to do. think about what would work for you and dive in. i am a licensed professional counselor, so i am biased - but i really believe that counseling works. having an objective, professional voice that can guide you on this process is so valuable. but please choose what makes you feel comfortable - not what everyone else says. i think you are very brave for reaching out and wanting to work on this. that takes a tremendous amount of courage and strength."

"is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","yes, it is very normal. some people cry frequently, but not fully. theyre good at crying but never seem to heal from whats hurting them.crying is supposed to be good for you. tears contain toxins, after all. and feel-good chemicals are released in the body whenever we cry tears of sadness.never judge your feelings while youre having them theres always a reason somethings a big deal to you.cry for your own pain, not just for others. crying in movies and when listening to sad songs is a good way to let off some built-up emotion. but you may not be dealing directly with your own hurts when that happens. remember its okay to cry for yourself. let yourself cry over spilt milk. you dont have to wait till somebody dies. you can cry about anything that triggers you, no matter how seemingly trivial.dont set a time limit on tears. your heart will decide when enough is enough. if you connect with the true source of your pain, youll find its finite. but you dont get to dictate a time limit for your sorrow. be patient. pick up where you left off. if you have to keep a stiff upper lip, perhaps because youre at work, check in with yourself later and see how you feel. reflect on the incident in private if you feel its unresolved. dont stress out if you cant recapture the pain. tears are like cats: you cant lead them on a leash. speak only kind words to yourself. when you cry, watch for self-critical and invalidating self-talk like this:its not that big a dealim too sensitivebig boysgirls dont cryinstead, say, im sorry and im with you and i love you. dont say these things in order to make yourself stop crying. say them in order to be compassionate to yourself. cry in public. if youve never cried in public before, you may be surprised to find that many people will be drawn to you. your tears make you vulnerable, and therefore no threat to others. kindness is a frequent response to public tears.if you remember just one thing from this post, let it be self-compassion."

"after he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. now he is depressed and hopeless again.","i appreciate that you are concerned about your husbands emotions and want to support him as best you can right now. i imagine that you must be going through your own difficult time too. youve had a complicated shock and trauma in your life and in your marriage its normal for both of your emotions to move from hope to despair to fear, anger, gratitude... there is no wrong way to feel and there is no particular pattern your emotions or his will follow. try not to assume what he is feeling but ask him instead. how are you doing today? is something that can be asked over and over again and your love and compassion for him will come through. if he has a hard time talking, you can share your observations. i notice youre more withdrawn. this worries me. certainly it will help you if you know what hes thinking and feeling because he hid his intentions to hurt himself. its normal that you want to know. if there is depression and hopelessness, this likely was part of what led to his initial despair. there is help out there. depression is treatable, and seeking that treatment is important right now at this vulnerable time. this is the kind of complex situation that can be assisted by a therapist who is qualified to help you both understand and manage your emotions. whether your husband seeks help or not, i hope that you do."

"we had great chemistry, but then he became distant. i had the feeling that i cant be without him. as soon as i felt the difference, i was scared to lose him. i started freaking out if he did not answer, thinking that something bad happened.","the simplest answer is that love feels good, obsessions dont.love deepens a sense of peacefulness and security.obsessions give anxiety and worry of feeling abandoned.one suggestion is to study more about yourself and why youd feel so ill at ease when you arent w this person."

"sometimes i cant stop thinking about life after death. i was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven. when i think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), i feel overwhelmed. i dont like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. sometimes i just cant get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety. am i crazy? i dont think these thoughts are normal.","your life here matters and being present in it so you feel joy in yourself and your surroundings is important in creating your sense of ease and balance. no one can predict, for sure, what happens after death because consciousness transcends boundaries and limits we tend to impose on it. that said, if reincarnation exists or if there is a heaven or hell your consciousness of it will most likely be free of discomfort or pain as you experience it now. meditating or doing self-hypnosis for anxiety can help alleviate your thoughts and sense of fear and living the a life of kindness and balance will assure that your future will be happy for you regardless of the unknown."

"i keep having these random thoughts that i dont want. things like you arent worth anything. i know theyre my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it. what is wrong with me, and how can i stop having these thoughts?","talking to a licensed profession who can discuss this in greater depth can be best. as a general information, in short, i can say that our thoughts are greatly influenced by our early life experiences. our thoughts are processed through schemes, these are mental images or templates by which we make meaning of the world around us. while our upbringing has a great influence on the way we see and interact with the world around us as adults, however, we are not condemned to abide by them for life, in psychotherapy, you learn to change negative schemas with positive ones. yeah, if you had less than optimal childhood you would have some sort of negative schemas that unconsciously lead to self-sabotage your efforts for success and happiness. the research in the field of interpersonal neurobiology suggests that without conscious awareness and reflective practices we tend to interact with the world by repeating old habits of mind. on the other hand, in psychotherapy you can learn helpful strategies to increase your conscious abilities to stay in control of your mind in the present moment and reduce intrusions of negative mind habits. yoga, meditation, and tai chi are also found to increase self-awareness and lessen the intrusions of negative self-judgment on ones psyche."

is this something i should be worried about? should i do something about it?,"my son plays alone at recess.is this something i should be worried about? should i do something about it?every mom is the expert on their childrens behavior. first of all, i suggest checking with your son, asking him if he is happy while playing alone, or does he complain that no one wants to play with him? does he plays alone in school, but is social in other environments, with family or neighbors?playing alone is healthy for children, it helps them to be independent and confident, it allows them to explore their environment and use their imagination, among other benefits. on the other hand, it is also important to develop social skills early on and become confident in our skills as we grow. children go through stages of exploration until they develop a sense of social confidence. depending on your sons age, he might need some input or advice. provide the opportunity to interact with other children, without pushing it. take him to the park to play with a friend or to childrens activities in your neighborhood. later ask him, what did he thought of the activity, and if he enjoyed playing there. children also follow their parents model, so you can encourage social interaction by greeting other and asking your son to do the same, ask him to receive the guests who come to the house with you and sit to enjoy the conversation. if you notice any shakiness, becoming tearful, anxious or aggressive when approaching social encounters, you may want to talk to the school counselor or childrens therapist to evaluate those symptoms and rule out any behavioral problems or social anxiety.mi hijo juega solo en el receso.debería preocuparme al respecto? debería hacer algo al respecto?cada mama es experta en la conducta de sus hijos. primero que nada te sugiero que revises con tu hijo y le preguntes si él se siente contento jugando solo, o si se queja porque nadie quiere jugar con él. observa si él juega solo en la escuela, pero es sociable en otros ambientes como con la familia o los vecinos. jugar solo puede ser saludable para los niños, les ayudo a ser independientes, desarrollan sentido de seguridad, y les permite explorar su ambiente y utilizar su imaginación, entre otros beneficios.por otro lado, también es importante desarrollar destrezas sociales y perfeccionarlas con la práctica. los niños van por etapas de exploración y prueba hasta que desarrollan un nivel de confianza en sus destrezas sociales. dependiendo de la edad de tu hijo, puede que el necesite algunos consejos. provéele la oportunidad de interactuar con otros niños, sin obligarlo. ya sea yendo al parque a jugar con vecinos, o a actividades comunitarias infantiles con algún amigo. luego pregúntale como le pareció la actividad y si le gusto compartir allí. también recuerda que los niños siguen el modelo de sus padres, así que puedes motivarlo invitándolo a que salude a otros después de ti, o invitándolo a recibir a la visita que llega a la casa y que los acompañe durante la conversación.si observas que tu hijo está nervioso, lloroso, o agresivo cuando se acerca alguna actividad social, consulta con el consejero escolar o un consejero infantil para evaluar sus síntomas y descarta cualquier problema de conducta o ansiedad."
"my fiancé and i come from a strong christian background but both went off the straight and narrow once before. he is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that im not a virgin. he has a hard time in general accepting himself and others. his insecurities are hurting our relationship. how can i help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","one of the sometimes difficult things about being in a relationship is the fact that you can make goals for yourself, but you cant make goals for your partner. if your fiancé wants to learn to live more in the present and learn to let go of the past or move in a different direction, you can certainly assist him, but you cant independently make it happen.i wonder if both of you would be willing to have a discussion where he is able to explain to you what he is experiencing and you are able to listen for five, 10, 15 minutes in a way that is not blaming or pointing fingers or asking him to change, but just listening (kind of like an investigative reporter) so you can have more details and ask questions that you may have about what certain things mean, when it feels like to to him when this is discussed, etc. at that point, maybe he would willing to listen to your thoughts on the subject as well.also, if he wants to make a change, it may be helpful to see a therapist who specializes in working with couples. sometimes changes such as these require a great deal of personal awareness and there can be quite a bit of emotions attached, so it is often helpful to have someone there to assist.it may also be nice to have a discussion where you consider what makes you feel valued, appreciated, special, or loved, and also consider what makes your fiancé feel that way."

"a few years ago i was making love to my wife when for no known reason i lost my erection, now im in my early 30s and my problem has become more and more frequent. this is causing major problems for my ego and its diminishing my self esteem. this has resulted in ongoing depression and tearing apart my marriage. i am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues. i am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like i used to. what could be causing this, and what can i do about it?","for starters, know that this is a normal experience for many men at some point in their lives. while this can certainly cause some embarrassment, a diminished sexual esteem or relationship problems, it is important to know you are not alone. i am going to move forward assuming that you have already checked with a medical professional to rule out any medical problems that may be related to this. assuming that is the case, for most this happens for two primary reasons. it is either a short term biological shortage of blood flow to the penis. this can be caused my diet, lack of exercise, even stress. another primary reason for loss of erections are anxiety. have their been recent relationship issues? are you feeling as though you arent satisfied in the bedroom? these are just a few aspects that can cause subconscious anxiety and loss of erection. my suggestion to you would be to seek out a counselor that specializes in sexuality that can assist you in moving forward with this. best of luck!"

"my husband doesnt trust me for some past we had. i know all marriages have their ups and downs, but sometimes, i feel i am getting tired of the same thing over and over: that i am messing around, which i am not.","it is incredibly frustrating to not be trusted when you know you are doing nothing wrong. if the lack of trust on your husbands end has to do with something you did in the past, then be patient and give it time. once trust is broken it takes time and effort to gain it back. try seeing the situation from your husbands perspective, as often times looking at situations from different angles, gives us new understanding and insight. remember that you cant change how he feels, but you can help him to regain the trust by asking him what he needs and responding to his needs as best you can. seeing a couples counselor is never a bad idea and it would also be beneficial for you and oryour husband to seek out individual therapy. there may be other unknown factors that you are unaware of that are contributing to the trust issues and inability to resolve them. hope everything works out for you!"

"my friend is abusing her prescription medicine. even though she told me she didnt have any more pills, i found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.","first of all, where did you find the pills? did you have to go into her private space or things to find them? if so, you might want to do some research on codependency. i recommend the book the everything guide to codependency. you can find it here: . its not honest to go searching through someones things. you dislike the deceit in her, so why model it in yourself?if the pills were just left out, thats a different story. again though, model honesty. talk to about what you found. avoid being accusitory. a good old i found these...whats going on with this? might be a good place to start. tell her how it makes you feel. have you ever heard of i statements? google this....you will find a lot of good templates on how to frame this conversation. at the end of the day though, these are her choices. not yours. all you can do is tell her how you feel, make a few gentle suggestions, and get back to taking care of you. if it gets to the point where seeing her downward spiral is too much for you, let her know this and tell her you can no longer be involved, for the sake of your own health and sanity. there is nothing wrong with trying to help, but ask yourself, are you really being helpful? if you are starting to feel resentful, know that you have crossed the line into codependency and back away.hope this helps and all the best,aleisha"

"i dont know whats with me. im almost constantly angry. even when im happy, i still feel anger inside me. when i acknowledge it, it ruins my mood and takes over. i get angry at the littlest things. even if i think someone said something they didnt, it infuriates me. something perfectly normal can make me go off. when my anger flares up, i get a terrible pain in my chest that lasts for a while. its like there is a fire constantly burning in my body, and anger is gasoline.","hi nashville, im glad you want this to be different. it doesnt feel good to be angry all the time, and its stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships, im sure.working with a therapist, you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger. its likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness, and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old, tender, bruised emotion that weve simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. we develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions, and anger is one way of doing that. so, when someone looks at you in a certain way, or says something, youd rather be angry than feel powerless, or unimportant (or whatever your kryptonite feeling is). in that moment, your instinct is to blame whatever happened, no matter how small, because thats the thing that happened just before you got mad. you fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that persons face, or the shoe that someone left in front of the door...its that you cant stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if its on fire.i suggest finding a therapist to work with. you can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them. :)"

"he isnt violent, but he has anger issues and deep insecurities. hes working on them and has improved. we started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter. now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.","hello and thank you for your question. i worked for a number of years with people who have been both abused in their relationships and those who have been abusive. being involved in a relationship with a partner who does the behaviors you describe can be incredibly difficult, and many would argue is even harder than overcoming actual physical violence. i was a little confused about whether youre are still broken up with this person or if you are still thinking about it. i am going to assume you are still undecided. some of the things you are describing sound like emotional abuse. even without physical abuse, being emotionally abused can still be traumatizing. when partners question and accuse, they are often trying to exercise power and control over their partners by hurting them with unfounded accusations. the accusations serve to make someone feel guilty and to manipulate them. for example, if your partner accuses you of cheating when you go out bowling with friends, you may elect not to go bowling just to satisfy your partner and prevent a fight from occurring. the person being accused or questioned often tries to prove over and over again that they have done nothing wrong, but it doesnt matter. and that brings me to the point of what some people who experience these behaviors do in order to start feeling like they have some power again. here are just a few things:1. they realize there is no right answer. trying to be logical with someone who doesnt want to be logical doesnt work. many people simply stop trying to defend themselves against false accusations because there was no answer that would satisfy their partner anyway. in addition, the rules of the relationship seem to change on a daily basis, and what may be okay with your partner one day may make them angry the next. and this can leave people constantly feeling like they are on eggshells. 2. the find support. finding a support group or a group of people who remind you on a daily basis that you are a decent person is always a good idea. one of the things that can happen when we are with someone who does emotionally abusive things is begin to have a negative concept of ourselves. surrounding yourself with people who remind you that you are a good person is a great idea. 3. they reinvest in themselves. try to find some time for yourself. this couldnt possibly sound more cliché, but it is actually true. whether that is taking up a new hobby or doing an old one. one thing that can happen when emotional abuse takes place in a relationship is the person being abused can begin to isolate and not do the things that make them enjoy life. taking some time for the self can sometimes bring things into perspective.i dont know if you are still in counseling, but if you are and you are getting what you need then that is great. if not, there are others you can try. its important to find the right fit. as for the question of whether or not you should leave your partner, that is a question that can only be answered by you. but you could ask yourself some questions like these to help you decide:1. what are some of my values about relationships? do i want trust? honesty? ask yourself if you have these things in your relationship.2. do i feel like this relationship brings out the best in me, or does it seem to bring me down?3. if i want to stay in this relationship, what are some specific things that need to change? hope some of these suggestions help. good luck to you. be well.robin landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc"

"when i get around a particular person or when i go home, im just sad or irritated. the feeling comes and goes all day every day. i dont know what wrong. im not sure if im just making up symptoms and problems in my head or if there is something actually wrong.","feelings are real, is very unlikely that you are making them up since they are a response to the thoughts in your mind and your daily experiences and interactions. often we assume that feeling sadness is bad and that we should only feel happiness and joy but all feelings have a purpose: joy, sadness, anger, frustration, excitement, anxiety, among others. is not healthy to experience the same feeling for a long time, so we should learn to identify what causes them and how to process them so you can navigate through life experiences with more ease. i am a licensed professional counselor in texas, currently providing services in west houston. you may reach me at 787-466-5478 to schedule an appointment. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------me he estado sintiendo tristecuando salgo con una persona en particular o cuando llego a casa, estoy triste o irritado. el sentimiento viene y va todo el día. no sé qué está mal. no estoy seguro si estoy inventando los síntomas y problemas en mi cabeza o si algo realmente está mal. los sentimientos son muy reales, y es muy poco probable que los estés inventando, por que los sentimientos son una respuesta tanto a los pensamientos que hay en nuestra cabeza, y, a las situaciones que nos ocurren día a día. muchas veces pensamos que sentirnos triste está mal, y que solo debemos sentirnos alegres, pero todas las emociones tienen un propósito y razón de ser, tanto la alegría, como la tristeza, el coraje, la frustración, la excitación o el desespero, entre otros. no es bueno quedarnos estancados una emoción. así que es importante aprender a identificar que causa nuestros sentimientos, como procesarlos para poder superar nuestras emociones y movernos de una experiencia a otra con más tranquilidad. soy consejera profesional licenciada en texas y puerto rico, veo clientes en el este de houston y proveo servicios de tele terapia. para una cita puedes llamar al 787-466-5478."

"my boyfriend moved in with me a few months ago. i love him, but his dog is wrecking my house. every day we get home, there is a huge mess on the floor, and several things will be ripped up (including the couch). hes slowly eating all of the doors, and there will be food and poop everywhere. even though i come home during all of my breaks to take him out, he still poops and pees in the house every chance. i cant financially afford to have the dog wrecking my house. ive tried talking to my boyfriend about the dog to try and come up with a solution, but it never ends well. the dog is the only thing we fight about because i want him out of the house and my boyfriend doesnt want to see him go. its not the dog fault though i understand that. the dog is only a year old, and he isnt a bad dog. hes just too big of a dog for where he is he should be a farm dog instead of a town dog. i dont hate the dog, but i just cant afford to continue having my house torn to pieces.","every living creature needs time and support to adjust to a new situation.the dog is in a new place without the ability to understand the reason. this may explain what sounds like the dogs agitation. have you spoken with your boyfriend on his opinion on how to address the dog behavior problems?finding an answer together would be a good way of making your relationship stronger. a lot of being a couple who live together is talking, listening and deciding together on how to handle major situations.if it is affordable, then a dog behaviorist may be of great help. the person would guide you in working with the dog to become calmer."

"how do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have? what characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has? ive read about this online, but id like to understand this from a therapists point of view.","this is a great question, and i am happy to have the opportunity to explain my approach. when i am determining what type of personality a client has, i take my time and really absorb their lens point of view to themselves and others. determining a personality type takes some time getting to know the person, and building rapport. after taking time to get to know them, and learning about their view they have of themselves and others, it is important to pick-up on more specific personality traits, which comprehensively contribute to a personality type. clinicians, including myself, often witness certain traits that are enduring and consistent, which indicate a type of personality. for example, if a therapist is noticing that a client is exhibiting traits of organization, needing to be on time, planning, and perfectionism, these traits contribute to the type a personality. in addition to utilizing clinical judgment, clinicians often use personality assessments and follow the guidelines of the dsm-5 icd-10."

were in an eight year relationship. my boyfriend drinks a lot. he experienced childhood trauma. i dont know how to deal with violent outbursts.,"first, let me extend my compassion to both of you -- it sounds like you have a lot on your plates. childhood trauma carries its negative effects into our adulthood and affects everyone who loves us. your question is brief, so ill just try to give general answers as best i can. from my experiences treating many people with your boyfriends experiences, the short, healthy answer is that you cant fix the situation and maybe not even be able to help. he needs a professional. period. what you can do, is take care of yourself. with his background, it is not likely that he will be able to help you or take care of you in a healthy way. your task needs to prioritize your own safety and well-being. trauma and substance abuse are the definition of being out of control, unable to set and manage appropriate boundaries, manage his own emotions and behaviors. so your boyfriend is unlikely to be able to change in the near-term, certainly not without professional help. you might also benefit from help and support, to understand your own role in your relationship and how you can make changes in your life. i am not blaming you for any aspect of your boyfriends behavior, only acknowledging that there are two people in every relationship. if you have accepted your boyfriends drinking and violent outbursts in the past (by staying in the relationship), that is likely to perpetuate his behavior. and there isnt any way to handle violent outbursts. they shouldnt be handled at all, and if you have to be away from your boyfriend during his outbursts in order to be emotionally and physically safe, then that may be what you will have to do. we can never really change anyone else. the only person we can change is ourselves. sometimes our behavior changes the odds of another persons behaviors, but it doesnt control it. i would recommend that you work with a professional to first, ensure your own safety above all. then make decisions about what behavior you are willing to accept or be connected to, and which you want to separate from. whatever your boyfriend does in his life, you will be happier if you manage your own feelings, set boundaries, etc. let me say again that you also would benefit from some good insight and support as you continue your journey. wishing you and your boyfriend healing and recovery."

i am on my own with my daughter. i am so worried and stressed about her.,"your instinct to help your daughter, is natural.how you proceed depends a lot on whether she recognizes she has a psychological and emotional problem, or if only you see this from observing her.also, her age matters a lot in what way would be most likely to succeed in addressing the problems you describe.if you and your daughter have different opinions as to whether or not she has problems, and she is above the legal age of when you have authority over her life, then you can only suggest to her that therapy may benefit her.if your daughter is in your legal control, then you can locate a counselor nearby, discuss your situation with that person, and depending on the outcome, youd be within your parenting right to take your daughter to a counselor.starting therapy without willingness to do so, is risky. the person may feel resentful enough to not participate. and, sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter, or any patients self-interest and engage them in therapy.family counseling, regardless of your daughters age, is another way to bring your concerns to your daughters attention, in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughters psychological problem, from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter, in how to handle certain situations.also, if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself, then instead of this slower route, get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town, for a more immediate response."

"our relationship ended about 7 years ago, but dont know how to let go. how can i get over that person and move on?","what youre most likely trying to get over is to be attracted to the qualities which you felt attracted to in the person.the problem isnt releasing yourself from the person, per se. letting go of a person means separating yourself from the qualities in a partner which you value.two possibilities exist.either you continue to feel strongly that the qualities in the past relationship are still meaningful and youd like to base your next relationship on these qualities.or, the person had qualities which are no longer relevant or necessary in your life and this is the reason the relationship ended.it is possible that even if you had an adequate exposure to certain qualities in someone that you simply miss the companionship of a relationship.see if you can figure out whether you need the qualities this person gave you or whether you simply like being part of a couple.if you like the particular qualities of your previous parter and these are still relevant to your life, youll attract a partner who has similar qualities.basically people attract what they need.the more open you are to attracting what you need in a partner, the more likely your next partner will have these qualities.in this way, youll get over the particular person and still have the satisfaction to be in a relationship."

"i have been married for ten years. my husband is 29 years my senior. we have a young daughter. ever since she was born, my husband has shut down. we have no intimacy he doesnt even kiss me. ive told him how i feel for years, and he swears he loves me and wants to make me happy, but i still have to literally beg for sex and affection. my self-esteem is gone, and i feel so alone. he has stranded me. he uses his passive-aggressive ways and ignores every comment i make. he refuses to talk to me in detail.","hi smyrna,your husband is avoiding dealing with this problem. i understand how lonely you must feel, not only sexually, but emotionally too.from what you describe, it seems that he wants to be there for you, but he clearly has barriers to engaging fully around this issue. my hunch is that he doesnt know what to do or how to talk to you. but i think he does have something to say.your husband is 29 years older and youve been together for ten years...that puts you at around thirty perhaps and him at almost sixty? has any wise older woman sat you down to explain that men sometimes have erectile issues or hormone-related low sex drive as they age? its possible that your husband is bewildered, angry, grieving or anxious about changes in his sex drive or his ability to maintain an erection, and that he doesnt know how to talk to you about this. he may feel like hes letting you down, and hes scared it will get worse, so hes sticking his head in the sand. of course, that doesnt help, does it?the worst case scenario is that you get angry or hopeless, that he senses danger or disapproval from you and pulls away even further in shame. eventually, you stop chasing him, and you drift further apart. its a bit of a conundrum...how to honour both your need for connection and honesty and his need for a safe place to explore his fears and insecurities. maybe lower your expectations for a bit? your husband will need to believe that you are a safe place to share his fears, and you would need to hold onto the fact that hes really scared, and that hes not rejecting you...just protecting himself.i would suggest having a gentle conversation that sounds something like sweetheart, we both know that somethings not right here. i think youve been trying to handle this on your own or hoping it would get better, but can we agree that its not? i need you to either talk to me about whats happening, or please go see a doctor. what i need is to see that you are doing some little step to help us. either of those things would show me that.in the end, you need to know that hes heard you and that hes willing to look at the issue in some way. if he does neither, then at least you know where you stand and you can decide whether to live in a sexless marriage. i wonder if showing him this answer to your question might help? just a thought."

i think about death all the time because i feel so alone. i want someone to love and someone to love me.,"feeling alone andor isolated is almost always associated with being depressed. as humans, we need connection and interaction with others in order to feel satisfied. given that you are frequently thinking about death, i highly recommend that you see a mental health professional as soon as possible to help assess your immediate needs and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to your feelings of loneliness and depression. the good news is that with proper, consistent treatment and commitment to change, things can really turn around for you. a therapist can work with you on building enjoyable activities into your daily routine, change maladaptive thought patterns that contribute to your sadness, and help with exploring what has gotten you to where you are. by learning about where your sadness originates, engaging in preferred activities, and changing your thought patterns, you should begin feeling relief from the burden of depression. what will likely result, is further opportunity to find social outlets and an increased ability to connect with others. dont give up. create some short terms goals that you can likely achieve and make your treatment a priority and a focus. you have already taken the first step in getting better by writing to this site. keep on this path and believe in yourself. best of luck to you!"

"i get so much anxiety, and i dont know why. i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes.","anxiety is simply your system communicating to you that you are in danger. the issue that i see in most of my clients is that they try to reason with this anxiety. you do not reason with sensory states in the body. if your system tells your in danger (your stomache feels like it is knots, your heart is beating out of your chest,) validate by just being present with it. take your breath to it. breath in and out of that space. say ok, i am in danger. i always tell my clients, a crying baby wants to be held, not told to shut up. listen to your system, validate it like you do a child and see what happens."
"my husband had an emotional affair with his ex-wife in november. she invited him to dinner, alone, with their daughter. i wasnt aware of this until after 11pm when i asked where he was. he had been drinking, and i told him not to come home that night. the next morning, we talked about going to counseling. he went out that night with friends and said his ex-wife wasnt going. i found out in april that she did go. i gave him the chance to get everything out in the open. i found out that he stayed that second night with her. i asked if they slept in the same bed, and he said yes, both nights. his daughter wasnt there the second night. he claims they didnt have sex, but what else should i think?","my answer is going to be super simplistic but i believe this may be what you need. ask your husband if he wants to stay married to you. if he says yes, then it would be helpful to go to a marriage counselor and work this out with a professional. if he says no, then you can file for divorce."

"something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for. when i think about what happened, i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.","hi ohio, i totally get how it can be more difficult to forgive ourselves than to forgive others. my guess is that you tend to come down too hard on yourself a lot. thats a huge barrier to happiness that you can work to reduce. ill get you started.you feel shame in a debilitating way that is probably way out of proportion to the incident. is it triggering some old shame? unfortunately, a lot of adults use shame as a motivator for kids. it doesnt work. when was the first time you remember feeling a lot of shame, as in im bad, or im worthless? is there a younger version of you who is still feeling shame over something that wasnt your fault? sometimes shame shadows are connected to an absent or hurtful parent, sexual abuse or some family loss or trauma. if so, picture yourself at that age. can you tell your child self that whatever horrible thing happened to them isnt their fault? can you have compassion for that child who first felt shame or had shame heaped on them? thats your first goal...to go to the source of the shame and heal that childs wound with compassion. what happens to children is never their fault (and fault is a pretty useless concept anyway).once you take the layers of old im bad shame off, the load is lighter and you can use self talk to further reduce the shame. here are some things you can say to yourself...every day...im human and thats okay. i dont have to be perfect.i can have compassion for my mistakes.i can feel proud that im facing my mistake and making things right.i deserve forgiveness and compassion, and i have that for other people too.theres no purpose to holding on to shame.i can learn from my mistakes and move forward.everyone makes mistakes.other people dont want me to carry this shame around.i dont need shame to remind me not to do it again. ive figured that out.shame tries to convince you that you need to carry it around in order to prevent further mistakes. poppycock. youve learned your lesson, now you can move forward to other mistakes. sorry...but youre human and youll keeping making... hopefully different, glorious mistakes. embrace the learning. lean into the experiences of life. its all juicy stuff, and youre in good company were all in the same position of being mortal."

"i had to go to the emergency room today to get an x-ray of my spine. my boyfriend didnt want to sit there and wait with me. instead, he wanted to go do things for his friends while i waited. when i was done, he was twenty minutes late in picking me up. he doesnt understand why im mad, and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things. he thinks i dont have a reason to be mad, but i believe that i do.","hi moore, underneath all your anger is a lot of hurt. the hurt is there because you are being disrespected. your boyfriend (unless youve only told me a small, disproportionate part of the bigger picture) doesnt tend to treat you like youre important and he dismisses your emotions. this is happening because this is the level of ability (disability?) he has right now in a relationship. you can expect more of this behaviour (because thats who he is it has nothing to do with you), and i hope you think carefully about whether its working for you to be in this. you could try telling him that you are hurt, because people tend to listen more to hurt than to anger, but my guess is with him it might not make a difference. i hope you talk to someone who knows and supports you about how youre feeling in this relationship."
"my girlfriends grandma passed away 5 months ago. they were very close. she took care of her till she died. things kinda returned to normal few weeks later. last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. intimacy fell off. i asked whats up. she says she cant connect with anyone and that its not me. she used to be very open and expressive. now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching. when we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off. now im very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. she says otherwise, but i dont know. it just feels like something is really off.","grief has a huge impact on us and everyones reaction is different. the one common reaction however is to shut down and distance ourselves. her relationship with her grandmother was close, given she took care of her up until she passed. it sounds like she is working through a difficult loss and her ability to connect with you, or anyone else, is likely low right now. trust what she is telling you and try to be there for her as she works through it. if she finds it too difficult to connect again, a good grief counselor can help her get back on track."
"im feeling rejected and frustrated. this is not new. the first month we were together, sex was about every day. then it slowed down to once a month right away. i love my husband, but i am struggling with this.","feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband. i want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you, and regardless of outcomes, i hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage. if your husband was to work with me id explore with him his understanding of, and experience with, intimacy in relationship with others. furthermore, like other male clients of mine, id challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his pcp (primary care physician) andor urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy. if there are no physical issues, per se, i would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin story-line regarding rules, roles, sex, and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories."

"i love him, but he doesnt show me love. he talks badly about me to his friends.","hello, and thank you for your question. loving someone who doesnt respect or treat you well can be enormously difficult and painful. many people who find themselves in an emotionally hurtful relationship say that it was wonderful when it first started, but that over time their partners behaviors changed and they became emotionally or physically abusive. i want to say right away that it is not your fault in any way if someone is abusive to you. it does not mean that you are broken or that there is something wrong with your character if you have not left the situation. people stay for many reasons, such as fear, finances, children, pressure from others, and love. many people have had to leave their abusive partners who they still love to preserve their own safety and regain the sense of self they may have lost. it is a very difficult thing to do, even if you know it is the right thing. the person who really needs to take a hard look at themselves is the person doing the abusing. it is very common for mental and emotional abuse to wear away at someones self-esteem. this can lead to other problems, like depression and anxiety. these issues sometimes require professional support to manage, such as a counselor or perhaps a doctor who may prescribe medication. a counselor may be able to help you sort through your fears and concerns about staying or leaving. to look at things from different angles, and to help you decide what is best for you. you have not said that your husband has been physically abusive to you, but if that has been the case, then you must consider your physical safety first. leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time. getting help from professionals would be critical, and i would recommend your local domestic violence program. whatever you decide to do is the right thing for you. i would encourage you to ask yourself honestly about your reasons for staying and the barriers that may keep you from going. you do deserve to be happy and emotionally safe. if you do not feel like you have that safety, then seeking someone to help you sort through these things is a good plan. i wish you well. robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc"

"for the last year, my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting. im at my wits end. how can i get them to stop and get along?","that is a good question. unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one. kids fight for different reasons - wanting attention, wanting respect, feeling jealous, wanting space and to be left alone, or a whole bunch of other reasons. regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting, most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them. these conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them. it is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong. the more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other. one exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is active listening where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding. this is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are. if this doesnt work it may be time to get a family therapist or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict."

"my dad is always, and i mean always, cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all. he makes me feel stupid. he also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me. is this abuse?","everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. having said that, everyone gets upset once in awhile and may yell or scream, which can be disrespectful. you said always, and i mean always and that is troubling. if your dad curses and screams at you on a regular and consistent basis, it can (as you stated) impact the way you feel about yourself. while the definitions of child abuse differ from state to state, talking to someone can help. perhaps there is a counselor at school, or another trustworthy person you could confide in to help you understand how this situation is impacting you? counseling is a good option. there is also help available through the national hotline at 1-800-422-4453, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. you can call (press 1) and talk to a counselor while being anonymous. you can also check out this website: am sorry that you are going though this situation. there is help available. you do not have to go through this situation alone."

(for you and for your wife and mom).- once you have considered these, think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation?- also, if your wife or mom were in your situation right now, what do you think they would do themselves?- if your wife and mom were in this situation, how would you feel? would you want to know the secrets?- how has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical health?once you have looked at the problem from all angles, you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not."

ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,for some people its absolutely normal to feel nervous about coming to therapy. its sometimes hard to share our emotions and feelings with someone --- no matter how warm and caring the therapist is. are you comfortable with your therapist? is it a good relational fit? maybe this is a good thing to discuss with your specific therapist at the beginning of your next session --- maybe they can help you find some strategies or tools to make it easier?
"after i told them, they yelled at me.","hello, and thank you for your question. i am very sorry that this was your experience with your family. i truly wish i could give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction, but unfortunately i cant do that. their acceptance of you is a journey, just like coming out is a journey for you. sometimes families initially respond this way, but after time they become more accepting and even supportive. unfortunately, there is no way to know for sure if that will happen. so, here are a few things i would suggest:surround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are. that wont take the place of your familys acceptance, and i wont even pretend that it would, but it may help during those days when it hurts the most. and that is really important. patience is not something that many of us are really good at, but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some. when families first learn something like this, they may go through a period of shock. and then sometimes even grieving. they may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden. these things can take time for them to reconcile, so it may just take some patience. if it is safe for you, try to talk to them, but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away. i do recommend setting up some personal boundaries for yourself, and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them. the reason i feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like youre describing. they may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around. they may, or they may not. and if they dont, you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are. to be surrounded by folks who remind you of that. if you start seeing this pattern and you are struggling, chatting with counselor may be a great idea. i am bias probably, but i think chatting with a counselor is always a good idea. :) hope this helps. be well. be you. robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc"

i am in my early 20s and i still live with my parents because i cant afford to live alone. my mother says that if i live under her roof i have to follow her rules. she is trying to control my life. what should i do?,"hi! im sorry you are having such a tough time with this situation. i have worked with a number of young adults in their 20s who have had to move back home after college , or even stay at home through the college years. bottom line is that either way , it is so difficult when you are trying to discover who you are and what you want your life to be , to have to live at home. i have even heard much older adults clients say that when they visit their childhood home , they suddenly feel like a kid again . the old dynamics between adults and their parents and siblings can pop right up as if they have gone back in time and are no longer adults !i would suggest that you approach your mom and say something like i am hoping we can talk about the best way for us to manage me living here. i really appreciate that you are giving me a place to live until i get on my feet , and i want to be respectful of you and our home at the same time , though, i feel like its important for me to have more independence than when i was younger because i am growing up and trying to learn more about myself and become more autonomous. can we talk about what might be fair rules that we can both live with ? if she is receptive , maybe you can each write a separate list of what you think would be fair and reasonable and then compare lists and try to make compromises and come up with a list of guidleines that feel fair to you both . if this is too hard to do alone , perhaps you and your mom can meet with a therapist a few times who can help you to come up with some kind of compromise contract. this is not an easy situation , but if you can approach your mom in a calm and mature way and suggest a planned, structured discussion that doesnt take place in the heat of the moment , your mom may be impressed by your maturity and even more receptive to working out some rules that you can both live with.good luck !!elissa gross"
what do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parents custody visitation?,"i will admit i am confused about this question. are you the other parent in question or a concerned coworker of this therapist? therapists do not prescribe or have access to medication. most therapists wont even get involved in a custody battle. they know there is a good chance of their records ending up in court and that they themselves will have to testify in court. of course, therapists are human and can make mistakes, but i find it highly unlikely that a therapist would knowingly and willingly do something like this that is such a major ethical violation. not only are they losing their license to practice by doing this, they are going to face criminal charges and jail time. if their clinical judgment is that the other parent is a danger to the child, they dont have to resort to illegal means to try to prove this. if you have concrete proof that this has happened then there is a process in which you can file a report against the therapist with their licensure board. every therapist is licensed in their state. there are different types of licensures so you would need to know this therapists licensure.most accusations from the other parent are expected in a custody situation because people do tend to get quite ugly. dont accuse the therapist or the parent of anything just to try to make yourself look better and them look bad. have evidence of wrongdoing before accusing them of this. if this has really happened then of course it needs to be reported, but dont try to ruin someones career unless you are sure this occurred."

"my therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. however, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. i have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back. i had a medical emergency last weekend and i was heavily medicated. i knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again. i dont know what to do.","im sorry to hear that this has happened. counselors are legally and ethically required to make sure that they always put the wellbeing of their clients above their own interests. in addition, counselor ethical rules, and the laws in just about every state, make it illegal for counselors to take advantage of a client financially. a counselor borrowing money from a client (even if the counselor pays it back) would usually be considered to be taking advantage of the client.there are a few options you have at this point if you cant (or dont want) to continue to try to contact him directly. you can file a complaint with your states regulatory board and let them know what has happened. an investigator will then look into the situation for you. another option would be for you to find a different counsleor who can provide you with an independent and netural point of view to help you figure out how you want to handle this situation."

"any time my family and friends are in an altercation, im the one who steps in. im the one they call to fight for them. i do this even though i have a tough time trusting the people im fighting for. im only in my early 20s.","breaking the patterns of relating to family members, is difficult work.in the situation you describe, both you and the family members who ask for your intervention, will be affected by any change you decide to make in the way all of you handle family disagreements.always, it is best for any two people who have a disagreement, to talk directly with each other. a third person distracts from the content and reasons for disagreeing.maybe knowing that by pulling yourself away from mediating family arguments, you will in the long term be doing good for your family, helps you do the actual work of separating yourself from their arguments.definitely, the fact that youre writing about the problem, shows you feel like doing something which feels better than how you feel currently.it is very healthy for you to listen to your gut intuition telling you to pull out of the mediator role you are in currently.you may feel guilty, your family members will most likely do everything possible to persuade, convince, and push you back into their arguments.this doesnt make them right in what theyre doing, it only makes your job harder of trying to let them have their fights on their own."

"i keep having these random thoughts that i dont want. things like you arent worth anything. i know theyre my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it. what is wrong with me, and how can i stop having these thoughts?","those critical thoughts most likely came into your mind as the way you understood what one of your parents or some other adult who was very meaningful to you, at a very young age.when we are too young to distinguish whether what a grown person tells us, feels accurate, we absorb their opinions as our own.your question shows youve reached the point of emotional maturity to know that your opinion about yourself is not the same as what is inside your emotional brain and stored there since you were too young to know that someone elses opinions are not necessarily your opinions.nothing is wrong with you, everything is right with you to wonder how to more firmly establish your own point of view.start the habit to revise any viewpoints about yourself which dont feel true.then replace these thoughts with better ones which you decide on your own.after a while of doing this youll either automatically think the more positive thoughts about yourself or at least be in the habit to know that negative viewpoints about you are not necessarily true."

i am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships. how can i fix my underlying issues?,"hi there. its great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. at the root of it is fear. fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. all those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you dont lose them. the thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. vicious circle, right? what i would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. you can start with this assignment. write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. for example, thinking something like, im too pushy, can be rewritten as, im assertive and i go after what i want. it can be hard to do since we tend to get stuck in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. if you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if thats not an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites that are out there. youve already taken the first step, so keep moving forward."

"i am in a high stress position for a tech company. i am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions and it is not only giving me anxiety, but also demoralizing. what can i do to manage my stress?","being in this position is tough. if seeking another career opportunity isnt viable, there are a couple of things you can do to manage stress on the job. 1. have a ritual to begin the day: consider setting a one sentence intention and plan tasks for the day2. take the breaks you are offered. i know it can be difficult to step away from your desk to eat lunch or take 10-minute breaks during the day, but prioritize this if you can. sometimes 30 minutes of downtime and fresh air can help you feel better. 3. have a ritual to end the day: if you commute by car consider an end of the day playlist. take a walk. light a candle. clear your desk and write tasks for the next day. whatever it is, send a signal to your brain that it is time to end the day.4. if you do work from home or are expected to be available after hours, set boundaries where you can. set a timer for answering emails and stick to that. have phone free meals. try to engage in activities that are rejuvenating like spending time the friends and family. 5. try to limit alcohol drugs. move as much as you can. get outside in natural sunlight. these are just ideas suggestions. even doing one of these things could be a step in the right direction. best of luck!"

"we dont have sex a lot. i cheat when we argue. i dont kiss or have unprotected sex with them. its a one time thing, and i never see them twice.","hello, and thank you for your question. the question about whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered by you. however, here are a few things to consider and questions to ask yourself to help you find your answer: 1. do you feel like you are violating your own values or morals? this is important, because we all have different values and morals surrounding sex, love, and monogamy. if you value monogamous relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner, then you may feel like you are living in contradiction to your values, and most people are not happy when they do that. however, if monogamy is not something you value, then perhaps it is time to re-evaluate the relationship and determine if it is still right for you. not all people want monogamous relationships, and that is alright. finally, if you value your husbands feelings and know that the affairs would hurt him, then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your own values. that can only be determined by you. 2. based on how you describe your relationship, it sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is. from the outside, it looks like the affairs are a way to get even with your husband or to feel better after an argument. this is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a relationship and gets replaced with contempt. we can simply stop caring about how our actions hurt each other, or potentially hurt each other. perhaps the question to ask here is, when you look out toward the future with your husband, is this the pattern that you want to keep? the pattern of very little sex, argument, and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs. 3. what are your goals for this relationship? if we start to become disconnected in a relationship, we can begin to do things on autopilot. get up, get the kids up, go to work, come home, and go to bed. none of which requires any intimacy at all. are you still able to see the hopes and dreams you once had for this relationship? 4. have you considered seeking marital counseling? not having affairs wont actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading you to have them. if there is something broken, it sometimes requires some help to get it fixed. hopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come to some kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship. i certainly wish you well. robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc"

"i have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and i just had my first kiss five months ago. im worried that, at this rate, i wont have a boyfriend for a very long time. the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, i dont want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. i feel dirty by doing this, but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal. most people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking. i am tall, i play lots of sports, and i get excellent grades in school. i am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. it bothers me. most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. i feel like i will be single forever sometimes.","hi winters, im so glad you wrote, because i think there are a lot of young women experiencing the exact same thing. you feel self-loathing for both being a virgin, and for being sexually active. young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what theyre supposed to be. they feel pressure to be pure, and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually. but you cant be both, so you cant ever win if you buy into all that horse manure (excuse my language). this current hook-up culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless. the stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship they feel guilt, and loneliness. i urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings. my hope and prayer is that they will echo my words here.your value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you, whether you turn his eye, or how he treats you. your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are, and it is to be celebrated. i love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares. who you are is so very much more than your sexuality. you sound like you have a lot of things going for you. try to see all of those things when you think of yourself.there are many more virgins out there, and many are afraid, like you, that they dont fit in. we are all different, and you dont have to be anything but who you want to be who you are. you dont have to have any kind of sex until youre ready, and that makes you brave and smart, not weird.youre tall and beautiful, and guys may be intimidated by that. it may take time for you to meet the right guy, but hes out there. the question is: how do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path? i hope you talk to someone soon and find out that your feelings are normal. i wish you the best."
"my wife and i got separated because i asked about her contact with a male friend of hers. the next day, she kicked me out. she let me move back two days later. yesterday, she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind. i asked if the other guy was a factor, but she says its not my business.","this has to be very confusing.i wonder if the two of you would be able to have a conversation about what it is that she would like you to know about what happened yesterday and the day before so you know what message she wanted you to get out of all of that.i would also recommend seeing a local mental health professional. if you go yourself, you could at least discuss your marriage and your own thoughts and feelings about it. if you go together, i would suggest you see a therapist who specializes in couples."
"maybe this is a stupid question, but i sometimes dont know whats real or not. if feel at times like everyones lying. how do i know if god is one of those lies?","the way that i see it is that humans have always been afraid of life and death, historically we have always tried to understand life, we try to organize it, categorize it, explore it, and weve built up this system, our system and societies system around us to help us define what life and (death) is, this system or way is not real but only a perception of our own value judgements, it is, no matter how you try to argue it, a false system of conditioning, humans have a finite mind and a finite mind cannot ever hope to understand an infinite mind of which a god would be. god has been developed over time as a security blanket for our child-like selves, the world is a beautifully brutal place and what is more reassuring than a master that will take care of us and show us the way. on earth alone there are thousands of gods and even many more systems of thought, economics, societal structures and so on, it is almost as though it were a supermarket with so many choices, we have more choices in gods than we do flavors of ice cream at baskin-robbins, so then i ask you, which one is real?, and what is real?"
"i was married to a narcissist sociopath for 10 years. during that time i was a general manager. i used to help him financially and in other ways when we were together. but things began to change. he emotionally and sexually drained me. i lost my spirit. i used to be a very happy person but now i am a loner. i left him and moved to another state. currently, im working as a server which makes me believe less in myself. i feel pity for myself a lot but dont know what to do. when i have money problems, he does not help me. he actually enjoys seeing me have a hard time in my life. i need help.","congratulations on leaving your marriage!it is ok and natural to feel sadness, loss, uncertainty in direction, hurt, resulting from ending the marriage.possibly what you consider pity is a combination of these feelings.be kind and caring toward who you are since you just put yourself through a major separation and need time to clear out the old emotions that connected you to your ex.there is very, very little chance of him helping you since he lacks compassion and empathy.more likely any help he gave would be in order to manipulate you.maybe for now your server job is ok do you have more time to concentrate on taking care of your emotions.you were a manager once, you can be a manager again when you feel ready for doing so.good luck!"

im having relationship problems and i want to fix them to make things right before i lose her. how can i learn how to listen and get myself together?,"what an important question, and the fact that youre asking it is a big step in the right direction. to answer in detail would require having quite a bit more information about what relationship problems have occurred that woke you up to the fact that youre not listening as well as you could and that youre running the risk of losing her.given that i dont have all that information, ill offer one simple suggestion. your girlfriend is the expert on what she needs and wants in relationship. you could simply say to her that you know you still have a lot to learn about how to have a good relationship and you realize youre not yet understanding what she needs and you really want to. then take a deep breath, settle down, and listen. dont argue, dont interrupt, dont judge... listen. let her know what you understand and that youre open to hearing more, learning more if youre not quite getting it yet... and then listen some more. be present and curious about this person you love dearly and dont want to lose. this is the first step toward intimacy."

"i feel insecure in my life. i dont think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does. i have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues. i have had a drinking problem for a few years. i feel the reason i drink is not just because i like to, but because i have lately been on edge. ive been very oddly emotional when watching movies that i have been watching for years. im paranoid about driving on main roads. im very jumpy at the slightest noises.","given the description you have posted here, it may be time to find someone to work with. first and foremost, look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking. this would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing, it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism, there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been effected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research. there are however, ways to address this. as for coping mechanisms, the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the dialectic behavior therapy model (dbt) which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation. mindfulness, another component of dbt should also prove to be useful in both becoming aware of your state of mind and emotional state to allow you to make different choices which has been supported by a growing body of evidence. there are also other tools designed to help repair damaged relationships. well worth looking into.seeking help is never easy and it is only human to be hesitant given some of the cultural views of working with therapist. this is a difficult place to be in and one that is not easy to move out of, but sitting on it is not going to help it go away. think of it this way, if you broke your arm, would you just wrap it up and hope for the best? or seek out a professional to help you set the break and teach you how to mend the wound. the same applies here. think of it as first aid for the mind."

"whether its to a guy or girl, i always feel insecure talking, and i am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough. even when i am walking, i worry about my appearance and facial expression and such.","i want to add that one way therapy can help with social anxiety is to give you a corrective experience. each week, you sit across from someone who genuinely cares about you, who doesnt judge you, and who you can voice your concerns to. over time, you show them more and more of yourself, and as they get to know you, they still care about you, they still dont judge you, and they still think you are amazing. find a therapist you connect with."

is this something i should be worried about? should i do something about it?,"it can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships. parents can usually tell when their child is happy. but kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment, perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner. others may internalize symptoms, appearing sad or withdrawn. a parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone. a parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground, and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play, unsure of how to join the group. therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends. itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child, but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer group ask a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play. if a mom or dad can make the play dates happen, or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys, the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own. i encourage well-meaning parents to choose words carefully. use phrases like, hey, i noticed something, or let me help you be successful. by showing respect, parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zone.when to seek professional help. when does isolation raise a red flag for long-term issues? true personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood. still, professional counseling should be considered if the anti-social behavior is causing the child significant distress, perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities. also, parents should pay attention to how the childs social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety. the vast majority of children who define quality time as time alone are perfectly happy, healthy and normal. if the child is able to nurture at least one friendship, exhibiting what experts call social reciprocity, then parents can relax, and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company."

"i have ptsd from childhood events and other traumas as an adult. i have panic attacks, nightmares, anger, and at times depression. i feel like im always on the edge or just apathetic. can i fix this by myself?","when it comes to trauma, especially in the event that it has caused you to develop ptsd, there can be a lot of difficulty in attempting to resolve these issues on your own simply because of how strong your urge to avoid it whenever thoughts of the traumatic experience come up. ptsd is best treated with the help of a mental health professional and if using the cognitive processing approach can be treated in as few as 17 weeks. as for your other concerns, many of these can be treated independently if you have the motivation to manage your way through. panic attacks and depression, specifically, often respond well to self-help treatment manuals. the centre for clinical interventions is a great online resource for workbooks to help you learn to manage the depression and panic attacks. whether you decide to work through these concerns on your own or in professional therapy, just know that your panic attacks must be managed prior to addressing your trauma. hope this is helpful and if you have any other questions dont hesitate to ask."
"i am not sure if i am depressed. i dont know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.","depending on your relationship with your parents, inviting them to have a conversation might be a good first step. if they consent then you can have the opportunity to discuss your concerns with them. inviting someone to a conversation and getting their agreement is a great first step. i would then make sure your location of the discussion is conducive to the conversation and once all that is considered it might be beneficial that you make a list of your concerns prior to the meeting. this can help keep you on point."

i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit. i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. i was very embarrassed.,"everybody does something or a few things in their life which looking back, the person wishes they hadnt.the key to feeling better is to realize that as long as you learn something for the future from your mistake, then you will be doing all that any human being is capable of doing.your mistake sounds genuine, not that you were deliberately trying to create a stir or harm yourself or anyone.now that this student in your class pointed out your mistake, you will learn to notice the appearance of your swimwear.put in context that feeling foolish for doing something embarrassing means that overall, you generally do most activity in your life, in non-foolish ways.the incident would only bother someone who generally is responsible. the mistake is a contrast with what is usual behavior for you.i hope youll enjoy swimsuit shopping and find a beautiful bargain!"
i have trouble sleeping at night. i wake up multiple times and cant seem to get back to sleep.,"sleep disturbances can be very challenging, and we can work together to identify any underlying causes, such as anxiety or physical discomfort. lets explore different tips and strategies for improving sleep quality, such as creating a relaxing bedtime routine, limiting screen time before bed, and practicing relaxation techniques."

"i have a problem with binge eating, especially during times of stress. i binge eat and feel so overwhelmed with shame and disappointment that i end up going to the gym and trying to exercise the calories off. i am in my late 20s, and i have been dealing with this since i was a teenager. are there any coping mechanisms i can use to break this cycle?","the fact that you are aware of the issue and what causes it is a step in the right direction. you can absolutely break the cycle but it takes a lot of effort. much like growing a physical muscle, developing coping mechanisms must be practiced (exercised) in order to gain strength. find healthy activities that you like to do that can help you deal with stress. it appears that you are already going to the gym which is awesome you want this to be a healthy experience not one done out of guilt. is it possible for you to incorporate food items that are healthy for you? remember any changes you make must be practiced and developed over time. you should seek professional help to assist you with getting to the root cause of your emotional connection to food. normally these issues date back to childhood experiences however this is a generalization and i have little information to go on. above all else be kind to yourself! shame is counterproductive. if you want something to grow you give it love and attention. well wishes!!!!!!"

"something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for. when i think about what happened, i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.","what a beautiful discussion of guilt and shame lynda offers! those two demons start out as pesky and little when we are young, then grow with us to become quite formidable. id like to throw in a technique i learned from randy rausch (author of the last lecture) called the 3-step apology. i teach this important bit of wisdom to my clients when they need to apologize to someone else but more importantly when they need to forgive themselves.yes, when we have trouble forgiving ourselves we sometimes forget that there is part of us that just doesnt know how to apologize effectively. here goes:step one: say what you did and the damage it caused.step two: say youre sorry and accept full responsibility (no excuses, no explanation, no defensiveness: it was all my fault.)step three: ask what you can do to repair the damage.step three is the one many of us didnt learn growing up. and when we add it to an apology, we are usually surprised that the penalty is as light as it is. of course, sometimes the apology is not accepted and no way to atone is offered. so be it, we cant control this. but if we are apologizing to ourselves, we can. there is always a way to make amends if we put our heart into it. give this a try the next time youre reluctant to let yourself off the hook. you might surprise yourself when how benevolent you can be when invited."
"he said he would try and he never did. its been nine months, and this is making me worse. today, he said i have to respect whatever decision he makes. is that true? am i supposed to respect the decision to leave because he cant handle what im going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night? hes constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out.","wow that is tough. there is nothing worse than fearing abandonment when you are already struggling with depression. it sounds like you are still wanting to work through whatever challenges you and your husband are having but your husband may not be on the same page. i would encourage you and your husband to seek professional support if you havent already. while depression can put real strains on a relationship, relationship problems can lead to or contribute to depression and there may be some real benefits to both of you in doing some couple therapy. with that being said - if your husband is not willing to do therapy or is clear that he wants the relationship to end, then i cant see what choice you have but to respect his decision as you mentioned. this doesnt mean that you have to feel okay with the decision - as im sure you wouldnt - but ultimately loving one another and staying in committed relationships is a choice that we each have to make. if he is wanting to leave - this could make things a lot tougher for you. i would encourage you to seek professional support for yourself and reach out to lots of friends and family. you do not need to face depression alone - nor should you have to. we all need support at tough times like these."

i have a friend that who i used to be in a relationship with. it was brief and turned into us being just good friends. i spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. was i wrong?,"hello. there are a number of factors playing into this situation. a former romantic partner coming back onto the scene during a current relationship you spending alone time (and spending the night) with that former partner and the uneasy feelings experienced by your current partner (boyfriend). now those are the ones you have openly expressed. there are very likely other issues that prompted this behavior on your part. you ask if you were wrong. it is not a question i will be able to answer, because it is not one i am meant to answer. it is up to you to find that truth. now, if you are feeling guilty, was it because of some sexual engagement occurred when you spent the night? if so, you might want to look at why that happened. do you feel secure in your current relationship? is this the relationship you want, or do you want to be with the former boyfriend?important questions, but ones you need to ask and answer. odds are, there is something that triggered this event to occur and it becomes a focal point in discovering any unexplored discomfort or other issues with your current boyfriend. seeking relationship counseling can be effective in sorting this out, so be open to that possibility to help you clarify your thoughts and feelings.best of luck to you."

"i told her that if daddy dies, we will never see him again. she started crying because i wouldnt make her daddy die.","toddlers dont have the intellectual capacity to conceptualize.better to find out why she wants daddy to die than explain the future consequences of death to your toddler.a person must be around 9, possibly 8 years old before absorbing the potential effects of an action taken in present time.pretty much your toddler demonstrated to you here age appropriate and limited understanding of the loss of a parent, by crying that you werent able to magically make her father disappear.also, please pay attention and form your own opinions as to the reasons why your toddler would wish her fathers death.she may be pointing out that the father behaves in frightening or harmful ways towards her."
i love my girlfriend so much. i get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her. but the two times we tried to have sex i couldnt get an erection. weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago. why this is happening and what can i do about it?,"this is something i have had to address with individuals often since working with couples is one of my practices focuses. the answer can depend upon several reasons all which tend to be explored while in session. if you or your counselor utilizes an integral approach, in which one of the main premises makes sure to check the four irreducible perspectives (subjective, intersubjective, objective and interobjective also known as the four quadrants) in determining where the challenges are, it then becomes possible to identify what might be contributing to or causing the challenge as well as offering up ways to address the situation.in this case, from the upper-right or behavioral and physical perspective, we would want to make sure there is no physical limitation or ailment meaning that you would need to visit your doctor and have the basics checked (such as blood pressure. we would also look at particular behaviors to see if you are doing something with is effecting performance (such as masturbating often or being influenced by pornography). next we would look at the upper left quadrant (thoughts, cognitions, identity, feelings) to look at what is going on here both during sexual activities and at other times. if you are worried about your job, your family or under immense pressure to perform at work or while intimate, this can contribute to your situation. from there we would turn to the lower left quadrant (cultural rules and tools) to see who you have learned to interpret challenges that come up during sex and look for ways to shift, update andor reshape the way you view sex and its challenges. it would be here that we would see whether one is even comfortable using a service like counseling based upon how your familyculture of origin views the profession. finally, we would need to account for challenges that show up in the lower right quadrant (systems, laws, rules of society) such as your economic ability to try services and products as well as whether such services and products were even available. once we have rolled through these areas it then becomes possible to look at which aspects might need to be looked at further in a more meaningful way to help you change a perspective or if just getting a blood pressure medication is all you need.to sum your question then of why you cant keep an erection we would need to look at your thoughts (look at your actual thoughts during the act as well as before and after), look at your behaviors, look at your physical body for issues, look at where you picked up your rules and tools (culture) and look at your ability to access goods and services. they all contribute equally and need to be taken into account. so - as you can see, there is no one possible answer to this, but several. i hope this helps."
"i recently went through a divorce. my ex-husband called my sister saying bad things about me. my sister never defended me. now that i showed the truth, shes shutting me up and saying she doesnt care about the fight. why didnt she convey that to him from the beginning?","unfortunately, i cant tell you what your sister was feeling or why she reacted that way.i can say that divorces can be difficult or confusing for everyone involved. while the divorce is most impactful for the couple going through it, the divorce itself also changes extended family dynamics. also, a lot of people dont act the same way around extended family (or other people) as they do at home behind closed doors, so there are times when divorce is a real shock to everyone who was not directly involved in it.i wonder if you are at a place where you can shift your focus into looking at your relationship with your sister, how she is treating you, how you feel around her now, etc. i do not know how close you were before all of this and how close you feel now, but perhaps if you can assess your overall relationship, you could find a time when you could ask about this (why she didnt convey that to him from the beginning) in a way that is calm, not defensive, and is honestly looking for an answer from your sister, not looking to defend yourself at that moment. if that conversation can happen, it may be quite a difficult one, so it may be good to have something to think of to remind yourself that you are trying to gather information from her and him that conversation, its not about you, but is about where she was coming from. after you think you understand that (im saying that you understand where shes coming from, not that you agree with what shes saying), you could see if shes willing to listen to how you feel about it."
im having trouble sleeping at night. what can i do to help me fall asleep?,"there are several things you can try to improve your sleep quality. establishing a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and keeping your bedroom cool and dark can all be helpful. you can also try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. if these strategies dont work, it may be helpful to speak with a therapist to identify and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to your sleep difficulties."
"i just dont know what i want in life anymore. im cant figure out what it is that is keeping me distracted and unfocused. i cant put things into perspective at all. im just stuck, and im disappointed with my lack of accomplishments.","it sounds as if you would benefit from talking with a local mental health professionals so you can discuss some details.having said that, i wonder if you could consider how you would define yourself to someone who doesnt know you. for example, honest, adaptable, fun-loving, dependable, compassionate, open-minded, dedicated, etc. if youre looking for a list of adjectives, try these: . there is a list of negative ones here too. if youre going to use those, try to use three positive ones for each of the negative ones. you could also try asking yourself what you love about yourself andor what others love about you. sometimes its easier to consider what others see as our positive points and if this is difficult for you, try asking someone who you trust to help you with the list.the idea here is to look at your relationship with yourself. i dont mean this in a way that you would be talking to yourself and receiving answers, but rather looking at yourself in a way that you deserve the same kind of loving and compassion that you give to others or want others to have.im also curious as to whether you are eating and sleeping okay, as these things can really affect your focus and many other changes, such as differences in your emotions. also, you saying that you are struggling to put things into perspective leads me to believe that you are going through some things right now that are not typical for you, if so, consider from whom you have support and the ability to talk about what you are going through.consider metta meditation here to help give yourself loving kindness:"
how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"it is usually time to end counseling sessions when it is clear to both the client and the counselor that therapeutic goals have been reached and enough improvement has been made that the client can continue without that support. there are exceptions to this rule, but for the most part this is when counselors begin termination. for some clients, this is an easy process that marks the achievements they have made in working through their emotions and difficulties. for some other clients, however, this is a difficult process in which they are losing a valuable support and are understandably anxious about what life will be like without the frequent meetings. ultimately, termination is different for everyone, and there are many ways that termination can be healthy and helpful."
my girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. she told me that she wants to move. what can i do to help her? i want her to stay.,"people often have very different values and opinions when they are drinking excessively and when they stop drinking so much.did the two of you share drinking as an activity? if yes, then did you stop drinking too?often when partners meet each other as drinking buddies when one gets sober, the relationship ends. once the terms of any relationship changes, one possibility is that it dissolves.the best way to go is to start the conversation of what you genuinely want. this is the only way shell really know your thoughts.ask her to give serious consideration and discussion over at least a few weeks or months, to moving away from you. this is a fair request since you are in a relationship.if shes changed so much by giving up drinking, which is possible, that she no longer wants to be in relationship to you, then you are better off being without a drinking gf, even if the truth she delivers is a hurtful one."

my brother has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has not been taking his medication. hes been using methamphetamine and alcohol and was found sleeping naked in my step mom driveway in 12 degree weather. i was adopted in by his dad (who just passed) and his mother will not get involved because shes afraid of financial responsibility. do i have the rights to be able to sign my brother into mentalhealth facility?,"thanks for asking this question. i know it can be really difficult to deal with issues like this.to answer your question, you might be able to get you brother some mental health help, even if he doesnt recognize that he needs it. in most states, an individual can request a mental health evaluation of a family member if that family member poses a danger to themselves or someone else, or if they are unable to take care of their own basic needs.you can always call 911 if you are concerned about his immediate safety (for example if you find him sleeping outside in below freezing weather. as an alternative to calling 911, you might also be able to request an evaluation from an authorized mental health provider. the deatsils of who you would contact vary from state to state. heres a link with some additional resources: lucky to have a brother who cares for his wellbeing as much as you do."
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,"sure, why not!its nerve-wracking to go to a man or woman youve never met before and who is a total stranger, that you are paying to take an interest in your life. youre likely feeling an internal truth about the sessions, the man or woman with you, and the man or woman sitting across from you. id listen to those feelings.wouldnt it not be best to go to those around you that do provide comfort and aid, first? wouldnt it be better to attend to those of faith around you who have love to offer, first? wouldnt it be better to go to your family and loved ones, first? :)might try that see if your nervousness evaporates..."

"for the last year, my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting. im at my wits end. how can i get them to stop and get along?","that is a good question. unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one. kids fight for different reasons - wanting attention, wanting respect, feeling jealous, wanting space and to be left alone, or a whole bunch of other reasons. regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting, most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them. these conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them. it is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong. the more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other. one exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is active listening where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding. this is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are. if this doesnt work it may be time to get a family therapist or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict."

how can i know if im just being paranoid?,"hi texas,oh, thats a powerful idea, isnt it? it burrows into your head. lets figure this out. first, has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them? have they cheated before? if not, then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence. if its a yes, then its natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need. when you refuse to let me see your phone i worry that youre hiding something. i need openness. if they havent cheated on you in the past, there are three possible scenarios here. i invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on. what is the specific thing thats triggering your fears? when you have your data recorded, read on...the first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and youve developed fears that you will be hurt again or that youre not enough to keep someone interested (this is just fear...people cheat for their own reasons, not because were not interesting). this may be true if what you wrote down is they didnt really do anything wrong...there is no evidence. im just scared and suspicious. thats a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like nothing has really happened. i can trust.if what you wrote down was vague evidence, like for example your partner has been distant or irritable, or youre having less sex than usual, you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions. trust your gut, but your gut isnt seeing evidence of cheating...its evidence of something. ask your partner whats up with accusations or assumptions.the third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating. maybe there are texts on a phone, or someone has told you something they saw. id say when there is some evidence, its okay to present this to your partner and ask whats going on. if this happens repeatedly, and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that dont make sense, then its okay to do a bit of research and be extra aware of whats going on around you. i hope that helps."
"i struggle with depression as well as pretty intense mood swings throughout the month. i experience highs where i feel amazing and energetic and then lows where i lack focus, energy, and generally have a more dark outlook on my life. how can i live a more balanced life?","are you certain your highs and lows are directly related to your cycle? its possible that there are at least some contributing factors, even if they are as a result of hormonal fluctuations.for example, at the start of your period, do you have that i feel great feeling, or are you tired and down? mid-cycle (assuming your periods are regular), do you find yourself napping or ready to run a race? either way, how you feel may be leading you to behaviors that contribute to your changes in energy and optimism. lets say that the few days before your period, you feel cranky, bloated and want salty food. your natural inclination might be to isolate, stay inside and eat chips. the next day, you feel even more tired, cranky and bloated. it starts with a hormonal symptom, but what you do with that can change how you end up feeling. so if you notice feeling cranky, bloated and craving salt, what if you pull up a restorative yoga video online, spend an hour being restful and centered in your body and have a good meal with a healthy balance of fats, proteins and carbs, with fresh veggies and fruits before you turn in early to give your body the rest it is asking for ? that sets you up to feel much better!and those on top of the world days - who doesnt love them?? but even those days, be mindful of how you are treating yourself. exercise for sure, but dont do twice the workout you normally would just because you can! you might feel super energy and skip meals which sets you up for poor sleep and feeling crummy after a day or two.all that aside, if you have a couple rough days before your period, pay attention to what is bugging you. christiane northrup, md, likens our menstrual cycle to the tide. when the tide is out (just before your period), you see all the garbage cluttering up your ocean floor, but you dont have the energy to address it, so there it stays, bugging you. at the height of physical and emotional energy (usually mid-cycleovulation), the tide is back in and you dont see all that annoying stuff you saw before. since you have good energy at this time, take advantage of it by doing some clean up on the things you saw there when you felt crummy. maybe its that conversation you have been putting off with your partner, or having the long-delayed closet clean out, or searching for a job that feelspaysfits you better. whatever it is, those pms blues may hold important messages for you.if taking good care of yourself, staying tuned in to your needs and keeping an eye on the tides dont help, then see your doctor. something else may be going on - our hormones all work together like a symphony - it only takes one to be out of tune to throw the whole thing off!"
i have been having horrendous nightmares this whole month.,"are you facing any type of overwhelming situation in your waking life?dreams and nightmares are the non-logical ways in which we make emotional sense of what goes on in our everyday waking world.besides having some type of relaxing bedtime routine to set a peaceful mood for your sleep, and avoiding viewing violent films and video games as entertainment, maybe even avoiding news stories which sometimes have similar themes of violence, the content of our dreams and nightmares is out of our direct control.your nightmares may offer useful clues as to what youre trying to resolve in your life. pay attention to the story of your nightmare because it reflects how you feel in waking life.if you feel helpless and silenced in your nightmare, or taken advantage of, or whatever dreadful situation goes on during your nightmare, then look for where in waking life, you may feel similar.in this way, youll become clearer about stressors in your life that you may not have realized existed were it not for the stress of nightmares."
i get angry and act out. it scares my wife and child.,"well, yes, of course it scares them. they see someone they love behaving is frightening ways. thats a good reason to want to manage your emotions differently...but what are your thoughts on your anger? do you think your angry feelings justify lashing out? the thing is that feeling angry is just that...feeling. acting out is behavior and that affects everyone around you. do you need to manage your behavior, as well as your feelings? my guess is that you do.first you need to pay better attention to your feelings thermostat. if you are always near boiling you dont have much margin for error. its in your best interest, and that of your family, to bring that temperature down. that may mean more physical activity, meditation, journaling or some other outlet.the next, and bigger, question is what are you so mad about? or are you really sad, scared, confused? anger is a secondary emotion, much like pneumonia is a secondary infection. anger, which sets us up to defend ourselves against a perceived danger, is often a cover for feelings that leave us more vulnerable. that means people who are grieving may exhibit rage people who are scared may lash out.that doesnt excuse bad behavior, but it might explain it. get in t o see a therapist asap. you need a bit of help to identify both anger triggers and underlying feelings that get played out as anger. you are not a bad person for exhibiting emotions, but anger can quickly become destructive - get help now!"

i have been married for 11 years. within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart. we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other. i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me. i feel very alone and just uncared for. is there anything i can do to feel reconnected?,"your question highlights your pain very clearly. what you are describing is one of the most common scenarios i see in my practice with couples: one partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward. my mind immediately goes to a question for you: what happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for? what do you say to yourself about you, about your spouse, and about your relationship? what do you do in response to these feelings? do you ask for what you need? does this lead to arguments? do you stay silent or withdraw?very often, couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship (and is often seen as cold and aloof towards the relationship), and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other (and is often seen as critical and nagging). regardless of who started it, these patterns can turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own, and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship. if both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship, the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together. as the patterns slow down, partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities, needs and longings, and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesnt leave the other partner feeling criticized, threatened, abandoned, or uncared for.some couples can do this without the help of a therapist. the book hold me tight: 7 conversations for a lifetime of love by sue johnson is a self-help book based on emotionally focused therapy (the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists), and has been helpful to many couples that i see. when a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals, i recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy (such as emotionally focused therapy. you can learn more about eft or find an eft therapist here: summarize:your pain is understandable and valid. its telling you what you are missing and what you want.reconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us, express those feelings in a safe way, and assert our wantsneeds, while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partner.if you can do that on your own, and your relationship is responsive, thats fantastic! if you encounter challenges in resolving this yourself, consider therapy with a trained couples therapist using a model that is scientifically validated. pain means this is important! you and your marriage are worth the effort!"

"my mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. she calls me every day complaining, but i dont want to hear it anymore.","it is important to set boundaries with those that stress you out. i encourage people to validate the other persons feelings by saying i am sorry you are going through this. then, to set the boundary bye stating what you need from them or what you are trying to do with your life to destress and that you cant be a listening ear right now. this will need to be a repeated conversation, but over time you will notice less stress."
"my husband and i have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. others have told me that most men would have left me by now. honestly, i think i have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. i want to be better connected with my husband.","there are a lot of different things that could be playing a role here.first, different people have unique levels of sex drive, and sometimes there is a hormonal imbalance.because you say both that there is a possibility that neither one of you actually knows what youre doing, and you want to be better connected with your husband, consider having some time where you sit together and touch each other in nonsexual ways and communicate about what you like and dont like. one person would be doing the touching and the other would be communicating. then the rules would switch. after you both become comfortable with that, you could try the same thing with touching that is sexual in nature.dr. tammy nelson is a therapist who specializes in relationships and sexual issues and she has several books and lots of other resources on her website: are actually therapists who specialize in sex therapy and if you are interested in that, you would want a therapist who is a csat (certified sex addiction therapist). this does not mean that they only specialize in sexual addiction, but they do have special training in discussing sexual elements of relationships and their training is quite extensive.in addition to connecting sexually, you may consider discussing with your husband whether each of you are aware of things that make you feel valued, special, loved, and appreciated. it may be that making positive changes related to your sex life would also improve your relationship, and vice versa."
im facing severe depression and anxiety and i just feel like im going through a lot. this really distracts me and i cant get my mind off the things that are bothering me. how do i overcome this anxierty and depression?,anxiety and depression are often linked. i dont consider them as diseases. depression is a symptom of deep hurts to the sense of self that leaves a person feeling shamed. anxiety is a symptom of not being given the proper emotional resources to handle the problems of life. it is also the result of being taught that life is a dangerous place that cant be managed.
"my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam. after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds. in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened, from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute. how do i know if he had sex?","unfortunately, you will never know the true answer. this is really frustrating to hear, but you will never 100 be able to guarantee that he has given you the truth. so if you can, work on accepting that, breathing through that,he may not fully remember, he may have lied to you in the past or he is lying now. he may have been honest then or he may be honest not. as for options, you can talk to him and provide a safe space for him to tell you what happened. this could be a private conversation with you or at a counseling session. he would need to feel safe to tell you the truth. but remember, there are no guarantees. you would need to make a decision to trust him or not. and go from there. a couples counselor can help guide that conversation, and make sure that he is feeling safe to share. more important than if he actually had sex or not, i would evaluate your relationship. do you trust him now? were there trust issues before? does he hide things now? identifying your current trust levels will be important for having a healthy relationship now. hope this helps, even if it is frustrating to not have guarantees."

what do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parents custody visitation?,"i will admit i am confused about this question. are you the other parent in question or a concerned coworker of this therapist? therapists do not prescribe or have access to medication. most therapists wont even get involved in a custody battle. they know there is a good chance of their records ending up in court and that they themselves will have to testify in court. of course, therapists are human and can make mistakes, but i find it highly unlikely that a therapist would knowingly and willingly do something like this that is such a major ethical violation. not only are they losing their license to practice by doing this, they are going to face criminal charges and jail time. if their clinical judgment is that the other parent is a danger to the child, they dont have to resort to illegal means to try to prove this. if you have concrete proof that this has happened then there is a process in which you can file a report against the therapist with their licensure board. every therapist is licensed in their state. there are different types of licensures so you would need to know this therapists licensure.most accusations from the other parent are expected in a custody situation because people do tend to get quite ugly. dont accuse the therapist or the parent of anything just to try to make yourself look better and them look bad. have evidence of wrongdoing before accusing them of this. if this has really happened then of course it needs to be reported, but dont try to ruin someones career unless you are sure this occurred."

"my fiancé and i have been in a relationship for two years. we have an infant son. my fiancé also has a child from a previous relationship. we do not live together. i live with my mother currently while i get on my feet, and hes living with some friends. my mother and i have an awful relationship that is completely unbearable most of the time. we cannot even stand to be around one another while living in the same house. she has made it clear that she wants me gone. recently, i was talking to my father who lives in a different state. my father and i have always had a good relationship. i explained to him the situation i am in with my mother, and he said he would like for me, my fiancé, and our son to come live with him and his wife. i would really love to go. i do not want my son to be in this environment with constant arguing and negativity any longer. there is nowhere else for me to stay while remaining in this state. the problem is my fiancé is refusing to move away with me because he does not want to leave behind his other child. he and his childs mother have a horrible relationship, and she would absolutely not be willing to let him visit if we moved away. i believe i would be doing what is best for my child by moving away, but i do not want to leave without my fiancé. i have already explained the situation to him, and he will not give in. do i continue to stay in this negative environment with my child and keep our family together? do i move away with my child and have my relationship end? i do not want to take him out of either of his kids lives. what do i do?","hi bethlehem,you have a big decision to make. i appreciate your fiancés need to stay close to his child and be a stand-up dad, and i am glad that you know your son needs an emotionally safe place.im a bit confused, because the obvious answer seems to be that you and your fiancé would get your own place together. i get that you want your dad to take care of all of you, but maybe its time to take responsibility for your own future and start building it independently of either parent. i say that without knowing how old you are, but if you have a child and a two year relationship, you basically have declared your independence anyway. i wish you the best."

how can i know if im just being paranoid?,"hi texas,oh, thats a powerful idea, isnt it? it burrows into your head. lets figure this out. first, has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them? have they cheated before? if not, then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence. if its a yes, then its natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need. when you refuse to let me see your phone i worry that youre hiding something. i need openness. if they havent cheated on you in the past, there are three possible scenarios here. i invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on. what is the specific thing thats triggering your fears? when you have your data recorded, read on...the first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and youve developed fears that you will be hurt again or that youre not enough to keep someone interested (this is just fear...people cheat for their own reasons, not because were not interesting). this may be true if what you wrote down is they didnt really do anything wrong...there is no evidence. im just scared and suspicious. thats a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like nothing has really happened. i can trust.if what you wrote down was vague evidence, like for example your partner has been distant or irritable, or youre having less sex than usual, you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions. trust your gut, but your gut isnt seeing evidence of cheating...its evidence of something. ask your partner whats up with accusations or assumptions.the third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating. maybe there are texts on a phone, or someone has told you something they saw. id say when there is some evidence, its okay to present this to your partner and ask whats going on. if this happens repeatedly, and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that dont make sense, then its okay to do a bit of research and be extra aware of whats going on around you. i hope that helps."

"i have a mother who is still running my life even though im almost 30 years old. i want to move out and live my own life, but it feels like as long as i do what my mom wants our relationship is okay. its never okay if i dont do what she wants. i dont know how to start making my own decisions and not worry about whether its right in her eyes. would it help for me to talk to someone about this?","if the only way the relationship you have with your mother feels okay is when she is the only one who makes decisions concerning your life, then this only seems ok.in fact it is not okay for one person to be the authority for another person unless the one for whom this is being done, does not have their own ability to think for themselves.separating your own wishes and way of handling life matters, from your mothers point of view, may be difficult.first, realize you need to get familiar with feeling at ease with the idea of deciding matters for yourself.youll need practice until you feel comfortable.unless, if youve been thinking through decisions youd like to make and the idea of your mothers anger is the only point which stopped you, then you may almost instantly start living in a liberated way of running your own life.basically, it is right and fair for you to have the chance to live your life the way you feel is best. be prepared that your mother may disagree with you and that her disagreement is not a reason itself to not do what you believe is in your best interest."
"i just got married with my husband. i have four kids of my own, and he accepts me with my kids. i am thankful he loves my kids even though theyre not his. now we are having problems in our relationship because of my past. i know all marriages have problems, but sometimes i feel its not going to work out if theres no trust. its hard for me to let go because i love him, but i am getting tired.","hi louisiana,you say that the problems are with your past, but my hunch is the problems are about his insecurity and his personal barriers to trust (unless youve recently revealed details of a sordid past?). you dont mention ever having hurt the trust in the relationship.trust is the first stage in a relationship. moving forward before they develop trust is a common mistake couples make, and now you two have involved children in a relationship thats missing a crucial element. but you didnt see this coming, did you? thats because only as we become emotionally intimate do our deeper fears and insecurities come to the surface. i give you credit for wanting it to work, and i believe you would benefit from the support of a therapist in working through the kinks related to trust. good luck!"

i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit. i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. i was very embarrassed.,"first i think we have to acknowledge that you are doing something amazing. you are putting yourself out there and becoming a water safety instructor. we often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive. next, you had an incident where someone pointed something out which may have caused embarrassment. whether or not it was malicious on his part i think the important thing to focus on is what is called common humanity. common humanity is one of the three elements of self-compassion. common humanity essentially recognizes that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience. while you may have had this embarrassing moment at this time, that boy may have had an embarrassing moment another day. we all have embarrassing moments. when we recognize that we do not suffer in isolation then we are able to move past that suffering. additionally another element to self-compassion is self-kindness. my question is why must you forgive yourself? rather, be kind to yourself for learning an amazing new talent."
"i was mentored by this guy for a few years spiritually. it was okay at times, but other times, it was just weird. i try not to think about it too much, but a lot of manipulation and lying happened, yet no one else really believed me when i told them. its like hes two different people, and no one else really sees that side of him. i was blamed for a lot of our troubles, and now we dont really talk much. im worried because hes in a trusted position of leadership and no one suspects anything. they just think im attacking his character. how do i know for sure?","it doesnt really matter what the actual diagnosis is, and whether or not he is an actual psychopath, he has manipulated and lied to you, and that is enough reason for you to stay far away from him. men (and women) with these characteristics can become violent. they can also make your life difficult by creating financial or legal trouble for you. again, forget about him, and contact the police if you think he is in a position to harm others."

"i am a really shy person. im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. how can i get more confident?","first of all, way to go in stretching yourself out of your comfort zone! you are sure to grow through all of this practice presenting to your peers, and that in itself will help to grow your confidence over time. in the meantime, do whatever you can to help yourself feel prepared for each presentation. do your work ahead of time so that you feel well-informed on your topic, and then spend the days leading up to your presentation practicing. do your presentation in the mirror, while you are driving (if it wont distract you from the road), and practice in front of a friend. on the day of the presentation, eat a balanced meal, get a pep talk from a supportive friend, use deep breathing to keep your body calm, and remind yourself that you are prepared. you got this!"

"i constantly have this urge to throw away all my stuff. its constantly on my mind and makes me feel anxious. i dont sleep because im thinking about something i can get rid of. i dont know why i do it. i started years ago when i lived with my dad then i stopped when i moved in with my mom. years later, it has started again.","since you wrote that you noticed a change in your throwing away urge when you changed with which parent you lived, would you feel that throwing away things is connected to wanting to be done with certain areas of influence with either parent?play in your mind with the metaphor of throwing away and whatever associations you feel toward this. are you feeling alarmed or freed, by throwing away things? im only suggesting these, not telling you that they apply necessarily.anxiety comes up when people feel helpless to manage a meaningful part of their lives. so pay attention whether your stuff represents difficult scenarios or phases of your growing up years. possibly you are trying to rid yourself of painful feelings which were part of your early years relationship with either parent.basically, sounds as though you are trying to establish a clearer sense of who you are and the throwing away part is a means of discovering who you are, once all the clutter is released."
im feeling really depressed and hopeless. what can i do to feel better?,"its important to remember that depression is a treatable illness. one option is therapy, where we can work together to identify and address the root causes of your depression. exercise and spending time in nature can also be helpful in boosting mood. its also important to make sure youre getting enough sleep and eating a healthy diet. have you considered any of these options?"

i dont know what to say. i have never really known who i am.,"what exactly is it that you are looking for? different people define themselves in different ways. for example, one person may define himself by his values and morals while another identifies herself by her personality and characteristics. still, another person may define himself by his interests and hobbies. learning who you are as a person can take time and life experience. at the same time, who you are may change according to what experiences you have had and how you have dealt with them or felt about them. try viewing the journey of finding yourself as exciting and ongoing. allow yourself to feel emotions and learn how they relate to the experiences you have. this may help you to know more about what you value, what you like and dislike, and what you want for yourself in life. best of luck to you!"
"i am a peaceful person, but i often find myself having thoughts about killing people. eventhough i like the thoughts at the time, they make me cry. why do i feel like this?","hello, and thank you for your question. clearly this is something that has you very concerned. sometimes thoughts are just thoughts, and they are pretty harmless. many people have thoughts of killing someone, but they would never actually do it. they really dont even want to do it, they are just having a thought. other times, thoughts are a sign of something more serious, and we should receive help when they start to worry us. i would recommend meeting with a counselor to discuss these thoughts. it is usually a safe environment where you can get advice with little judgement. now, if you begin to start thinking about killing someone specific and making a plan to do it in reality- you should call for help immediately. by help, i mean 9-11, or a family member or friend. you would want to get help before doing something to harm yourself and others. again, none of this is to judge, but rather to encourage you to get the help youre seeking. either way, when we become concerned about some aspect of our behavior, seeking counseling is usually a good choice. be well, robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpcc, ncc"
"i am not sure if i am depressed. i dont know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.","depending on your relationship with your parents, inviting them to have a conversation might be a good first step. if they consent then you can have the opportunity to discuss your concerns with them. inviting someone to a conversation and getting their agreement is a great first step. i would then make sure your location of the discussion is conducive to the conversation and once all that is considered it might be beneficial that you make a list of your concerns prior to the meeting. this can help keep you on point."
"im in my early 20s. ive been married once, and he cheated on me. ever since then, ive felt ugly no matter what. im engaged, and i still feel ugly. i dont like to take pictures of myself.","sounds as though youre taking the blame for the bad actions of your former husband.he did an ugly action, and instead of feeling only your own emotions in response to being cheated on, you are holding his ugly behavior within you and feeling it.does this sound like a possible explanation of why your feeling of ugliness started after the cheating incident?you may start feeling better by looking within your own heart for the full effects of having been hurt. it is possible there is more suffering within you than youve realized until now.as you address all the emotional pain youve lived through, the feeling of ugliness may drop out all of its own. because youd be focused on you, not on any of the ugliness introduced into your life by your cheating ex husband."

"im a male in my 20s. my girlfriend is in her late 30s. shes great. shes funny and smart, she has a big heart, and we have an excellent sex life. she recently moved in with me partially because she wanted to and partially because she had no place to go. we fight a lot. its mostly my fault, i must admit. she doesnt like my insecurity and lack of trust i have for her. i have trust issues. also, i cant fathom why a woman like her is with me, so im always dreading when a better dude will come along. i dont think shes happy. shes very submissive and she loves me very much, but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay. i love her so much, but my jealousy is not likely to diminish. i never believed in the whole if you love them, let them go, but i do now. i really want her to be happy. should i end it with her? she has no place to go so i feel like i cant break up with her. im literally trapped.","hi fort worth, i applaud your awareness and insight into the relationship. most of us come into relationships carrying old baggage and although you cant change her, what you can do, is change yourself. we can usually begin to understand ourselves better in the context of our own upbringings. that is where we learn what a relationship looks like and it is often not the best teacher. i wonder about your jealously, insecurity, feeling trapped and a lack of trust. has that ever showed up anywhere before? it has more to do with you and less to do with her. your relationship with her is tapping into unresolved issues within yourself. that is really where you want to focus. once you understand it and resolve it, you will no longer need to ask anyone else what to do, because you will know. you are young and just getting started in the relationship world and the healthier you are, the better you will know what healthy looks like. know yourself, understand yourself and love yourself. the rest will take care of itself. finding a therapist can be a big help in this process. you are asking the question, so i suspect you are ready to look at the man in the mirror. i believe in you and am wishing you all the best.sandra cooper, rn, lpcmh"

"i broke up with him three weeks ago because i felt that he needed to be more respectful. he has since had a rebound relationship. he says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me. he says its going to be too difficult to see me. every time we talk, it feels like im being pushy to see him. he used to be so madly in love with me, but now, it seems like he couldnt care less. i think im running him away.","hi kansas,i think your first instinct was good you broke up with him. you deserve respect, but right now youre not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as hes moving on with a new relationship. its appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants, which is space. do you think hes going to be any different with her? this a common, unfounded fear we have. i wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him. the bottom line is you cant make someone love you, and you cant make someone be loving towards you, because how someone treats you (and the choices they make) has everything to do with who they are, and nothing to do with who you are. i hope you gather support from others and move on in hope and strength for your own future."

how do you know you have the right therapist for you? how would i know how to train my therapist to be able to give me what i need from treatment?,"this is a great question. a good therapist should first be someone you can trust and second, someone who encourages you to be honest with yourself. therapy is a time to learn new coping skills and learn more about yourself. you have the answers you need within yourself, but it sometimes takes a keen ear to lead you to those answers. this cant happen without trust and honesty. you may not always leave therapy feeling energized. therapy can be hard work. but, you should always feel you have gained something to ponder that will help you better understand yourself."

"i was raped a couple months ago, since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, i have been having trouble feeling emotions. its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling. what can i do to change this?","i am so sorry this has happened to you! i hope you have some people you find emotionally supportive around you! in terms of your question, i understand what you are talking about. sometimes when a person experiences a traumatic event, an event called dissociation occurs. dissociation is the brains way of temporary creating and increasing emotional distance between what is happening and what you are feeling and experiencing. this is a kind of natural coping mechanism, and it can occur just prior to, during, and after an event has occurred. people describe the feeling as being numb, or detached from others, their surroundings, and even from their own body. all of these descriptions are accurate and they are your brains attempt to try and keep you safe from emotions that may otherwise overwhelm you. this is good, in the short-term, because you are not having to immediately face and cope with the immensely painful feelings associated with your trauma. but it is also not-so-good in that it also blocks your ability to feel positive and pleasurable emotions. so while your brain is protecting you, it is also preventing feelings you need now more than ever (such as regaining a sense of safety, soothing your hurts, and feeling empowered for your survival).you are not a sociopath, so do not worry about that, but i would strongly recommend that you consider seeing a therapist or other supportive mental health professional to help you work through what is happened. there are ways for you to heal from your experience which will help you get back to a place where you can feel safe enough to feel again. it might be an uncomfortable journey, at times, but you are already hurting and your life is being negatively impacted, now. good therapy sometimes is like pulling out a splinter--it may hurt a bit to dig that sucker out, but once its out, your body can finally start to heal. it might seem better (and less painful) to leave it alone, and ignore (avoid) it. but you risk infection by your inaction which will be 100 x worse than just digging it out. best of luck to you!learn more about me and my practice at"

"i have been seeing this guy for a little over a year. back in august, he asked for us to step back for now. since then, he has still been in contact with me every day. we spent some time together over the holidays, but then i was gone for new years with family. i came to find out that he put himself on a dating site. when i found out, i asked him about it, and he responded with this: my apologies if i got my signals crossed, or if i wasnt honest with you. you have helped me tons this past year and i am glad you are in my life. i didnt realize you were still interested in dating. again, my apologies. also, is it better to say that i want him in my life or that i want him as part of my life?","it sounds like there is a bit of confusion regarding how you two feel about each other. do you know what type of relationship you want with him? a friendship only, casual dating, or an exclusive relationship? i would encourage you to first figure that out and then communicate to him how you are feeling. ask him to be honest with you about how he feels and what he wants from your relationship as well. be mentally prepared for a variety of responses from him so that there are no major surprises. by clearing the air and learning what your own and each others desires are, you can then move forward with a plan. without that clarification, there will likely be false assumptions, unanswered questions, and confusion."

i believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content. the father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs. his co-worker sent him an inappropriate video. he got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that.,"it sounds like you are wanting to protect your child from degrading images and that is one of the important parts of the job of a parent. although it is challenging to supply an answer without knowing the full situation, it might be helpful to have a more broad discussion about what you both think about the influences and images that your child is exposed to and what you think your role is in protecting your child. this situation is one about beliefs and values and could well be an example you can use for exploring your parenting roles in protecting your child."

"ive been bullied for years and the teachers have done nothing about it. i havent been diagnosed with depression, but i have been extremely sad for years. how can i deal with being bullied at school when the teachers wont help?","teachers dont do anything about it due to liability of the school (school and faculty would get sued and have claims made against them) wouldnt expect much out of themcouple things:1) realize that bullies accuse others of the very crimes they are doing themselves2) bullies arent actually all that weak as others have said, but do not stand up against constant pressure of truth-telling3) research yourself, or pay someone, to locate the bullys mother and father, and let them know what you have experienced (by way of text, phone, letter, etc.)4) access your own mother and father and tell them what you have experienced, and see if they will helplong term, society must return to a more masculine way of being such that these sorts of troubles are dealt with at the home :)learn to be manwoman, and watch the magic happen."
"my dad makes me feel like shit and like im worthless. he calls me names and makes me feel depressed. i want to move out because i swear if i stay here, im going to lose it. what can i do?","if youre actually able to afford to move out and support your own life, then this is a reasonable choice.if youre not in such a position and must continue for a while to live w your dad, then emotionally protect yourself from him.doing so is much more difficult than maybe it sounds.do you have privacy in your house and can you spend more time in a self-created safe space than around your dad?also, limit the amount of dialogue you have with him so you dont offer him a chance to feel invited to criticize you.are there other people who live in the household w you and dad?if yes, then are they similarly called names or are you singled out by him? what do the other family members do when they hear your dad calling you names?is it possible the other family members dont realize how hurt and upset you are by your dads behavior?if yes, then make a project for yourself to tell the other family members that you suffer from your dads name calling.it is possible the other family members will step in and tell your dad to stop.not necessarily that he will stop. knowing the others support you emotionally and find you credible is helpful on its own."

"im trying to make marriage work after a split. before our split, he lied a lot and broke every promise to me. i dont think he cheated. last month, i asked what women work with him, so he told me. yesterday, i found out about a girl that he said he forgot about. should i be upset?","do you want to be upset about a girl that he forgot about? think about it for a minute. do you want to measure your trust based on knowing how many female co-workers your husband has? and if so, what does that say about your marriage? trust is something that we earn based on our actions and the actions of people we interact with its also based on our ability to communicate and understand what we value and have in common. if you are focused on every little detail around your relationship, it may turn into an unhealthy obsession and it may harm your relationship more. if instead you focus on opening the lines of communication, let him know what you expect from him, and discuss how you could both build trust again, you may become closer and give your relationship the opportunity to grow. debería este molesta porque mi esposo me mintió de nuevo?estoy tratando de hacer que mi matrimonio funcione después de una separación. antes de separarnos el mentía mucho y rompía todas sus promesas. no creo que me haya sido infiel. el mes pasado, le pregunté cuantas mujeres trabajan con él, y él me dijo. ayer, me enteré que se olvido de una muchacha. debería estar enojada?quieres estar molesta porque se le olvido con cuantas mujeres trabaja? piénsalo por un momento. quieres determinar la confianza que le tienes en tu esposo basándote en su capacidad de reportar la cantidad de mujeres que trabajan con él? si tu respuesta es sí, qué refleja eso sobre tu matrimonio? la confianza es algo que se gana basado en nuestras acciones y las de aquellos con quienes interactuamos también en nuestra habilidad de comunicar y entender los valores que tenemos en común. si practicas estar preocupada por cada pequeño detalle en tu relación, esto se puede convertir en una obsesión que potencialmente dañara tu relación. si en cambio te enfocas en abrir las líneas de comunicación, le dejas saber lo que esperas de él y discuten cómo pueden trabajar juntos para recuperar la confianza, pueden volverse más cercanos y darse la oportunidad de que la relación crezca."

how does a person start the counseling process?,"great question. too often people search for the help they need via a phone book or a basic internet search. when looking for a new person to add to your team, whether it be a counselor, plumber, or mechanic, it is important to know as much as you reasonably can about the person. i generally take the following steps: 1.) know what is important to me in finding help. 2.) ask for referrals from my trusted friends, family, and colleagues. 3.) search for online reputation (better business bureau, yelp, etc). the absence of an online reputation is not necessarily a bar to consideration. however, a predominantly negative review may warrant further research. 4.) finally call the counselor and ask a few questions. let the counselor know what you are looking for. trust your gut. for example, if you feel rushed or do not receive thorough answer, move on to the next. taking the time to defining and conveying your requirements about what you are looking for in counseling can save you a lot of work down the road."

"sometimes i cant stop thinking about life after death. i was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven. when i think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), i feel overwhelmed. i dont like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. sometimes i just cant get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety. am i crazy? i dont think these thoughts are normal.","hi california, what youre experiencing is indeed anxiety its very common. through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety. ill get you started and its a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you well.its natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us. our brains are complex, wonderful things. fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it. but what happens sometimes is that our alarm systems get out of whack and get set off too easily. we often spend too much time worrying about things that happened or might happen. when these thoughts take away from our enjoyment of life, it becomes a problem. so, while fear and anxiety try to protect us, they also seek power and will take any power they can get.in general, fear and anxiety try to tell us one or both of two things: that something is wrong with us, or that something bad will happen (or that something bad will happen because theres something wrong with us). they will use anything they can as evidence to convince you. for example... that person looked at you funny. youre strange looking. well there are dozens of possible explanations for the look on that persons face, and its unlikely it had anything to do with you. for you personally, your thoughts are about the afterlife...about living forever. what does fear tell you will be uncomfortable about living forever? what would the worst part be? a therapist would help you dig deep to find the core of what you fear. it might be that you have no control over who you are or where you go. it might be that you fear going to hell because youre bad. search for that deepest fear.i invite you then to picture that thought as a glass of water on a shelf. its a heavy glass, and if you held it in your hands for a while and stared at it, it would get in the way youd be uncomfortable and unable to focus on your life. thats whats happening now. i suggest that the problem is not so much the thought youre having we all have random silly thoughts that usually arent true. the problem is how long youre holding it in your hand. you could have that thought (pick up that glass) a hundred times a day and, as long as you put it right back on the shelf, its not a problem. the trick is to get it back on that shelf.right now, youre using distraction to do this. youre trying to focus on other things around you, but i think the glass is still in your hand. its not enough youre looking for more tools to get that glass back on the shelf. and the key is in your thoughts. once you find out what fear is trying to tell you, then you can talk back to fear. so, as an example, if fear is saying to you you have no control over anything, then you can work to accept the pieces you dont have control over, learn to tolerate that feeling, and claim back the pieces you can control. you can control the extent to which you let fear take you over. with a therapist you can learn to refute fears ideas. you can learn to look for concrete evidence of fears lies and gain back control over your thoughts. i wish you the best!"

"i struggle with depression as well as pretty intense mood swings throughout the month. i experience highs where i feel amazing and energetic and then lows where i lack focus, energy, and generally have a more dark outlook on my life. how can i live a more balanced life?","depression and pms symptoms can be so hard to navigate ! looking at this from a holistic standpoint can help you understand why you get these mood swings and what to do to balance yourself emotionally during this time. as a woman, we experience peaks and dips during our hormonal cycles and right before menstruation, we tend to feel not ourselves and down. the bloating and extreme cravings do not help either.making sure your schedule is light and you have things to assist you can be so helpful. different essential oils like lavender may calm you down, or orange which can uplift your mood. homeopathy can be effective and gentle during this time as well. birth control is known to help reduce the extreme spikes in hormones and can reduce your emotional and physical pain. perhaps even psychiatric medication like an ssri can help . if you are interested in going down the medication route, be sure to ask the doctor about potential side effects and risks . reducing your processed sugar intake may help a lot as well. exercising, spending time outside, practicing stress management and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can all be useful as well."
"she refuses to talk to me and told my mom (her grand mother) that she is remembering things from the past. i dont know what to do. my daughter blames me and swears she hates me. my parents say i should just let my daughter live with her dad, but i dont see how i could fix things if i only see her every other weekend. what should i do?","sorry to hear about your high degree of stress.how old is your daughter?who abused yours daughter?the answers make a difference to your decision.obviously if the father was the abuser, then unless your ex demonstrates to you and you believe, he will not abuse her, your daughter should stay with you.if someone other than the father was the abuser and the father has a good relationship with your daughter, then it is possible that the time away from your household will give each of you time away from arguing with one another.what does your daughter tell you she wants?her wishes must be considered too.relationships can be fixed. sometimes being apart helps this process because the two people each have time to reflect more deeply on what they value about the other."
"i stopped for a while, but ive started doing it again. its like an addiction. the more i try to stop, the more i want to do it. ive tried doing some of the stuff they say to do like draw, but it doesnt work.","ive heard people say that they cut themselves as a way to feel relief from different emotions. youre also right that when you try to focus on just not cutting, it becomes more difficult because its what you are focused on. while that is still something to work on, it may also be helpful to find something else you can do instead. you said drawing doesnt work for you. sometimes more physical activities, such as doing a few jumping jacks, can be helpful. if you dont exercise, it might be something to talk with your doctor about first.the more you can learn about what makes you want to cut, the easier it will be to find out what you could do to change that. try talking to somebody about what you are feeling in addition to the urge to cut."
is this something i should be worried about? should i do something about it?,"the answer depends on how the other areas of your sons life are doing.is he happy or does he seem happy, playing alone during recess?does he have friends in other social circles besides the students whom hes with at recess?how is his academic progress?how is his social integration among his classmates?are there any special or unusual circumstances in the home and family environment?go through this list to form a fuller idea of whether your son simply likes alone time and takes this option during recess, or if any if the above areas show stress or difficulty for him and which need to be further understood and handled."
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,"it depends on your definition of normal!:) i would say that the average client i see feels some level of nervous energy when they come into their sessions, and especially at the beginning. i think that with clients who i work with that have difficult times in relationships, maybe being able to trust people is tougher for them given their life experiences, the expectation would be that they have a harder time moving through those nerves and feeling more at peace in sessions.in my opinion, a competent therapist could help you explore where these nerves are actually coming from (talking about yourself, relating to another, something else?) i encourage all of my clients to bring up whatever emotions are coming up for them in the moment, as its helpful to the client to recognize the present moment emotion and then being able to process, learn from, and move through to a more peaceful place, if that is what is being sought."

i am a survivor of multiple sexual abuserape experiences. triggers are having an effect on my daily life and my sexual relationship with my partner. im trying to learn to cope with them.,"im glad youre willing to keep optimistic about life improving and offering better relationships than some of the ones in which you greatly suffered.one suggestion is to develop patience with yourself and the process of regaining your willingness to trust other people.sexual intimacy engages all of who we truly are. being cautious as to who and how much you allow someone into your life, is natural for anyone recovering from trauma.allow yourself to withdraw when situations feel dangerous. your sense of danger is most likely on higher alert than had you not been victimized.be attentive and cooperate with your own sense of readiness to engage in conversation, discussions and sex with your partner.explain all this to your partner so the person can develop their own patience with your recuperation process."

"people who are parental figures in my life have, in the past, hurt me, and some continue to do so. it makes me feel like im not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me. i have had jobs, but i am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong. any time i bring these things up, i am expected to be over the issue. these are people that you cant just cut out, but i have never received apologies for so much of my pain. i dont know what to do any more. i dont know who i am anymore.","hello. adults who come from abusive home histories (physical, emotional, or even psychological), may take a long time to heal from that abuse. we carry our past with us everywhere we go, and it is up to us to find resolutions to past hurts. this is often easier said than done, but it is possible. from the perspective of those with whom you have shared your concerns, it might be assumed that based on where you are in life and who you are now, that you have already worked through any issues from your younger years. some of our deepest scars in life are indeed invisible and suppressed. we have to get to the place where we can take care of the inner child that is still hurting, by recognizing that those who hurt us - however they did, might have had their own challenges which prevented them from functioning and behaving in ways we might have deeply needed. those who have directly hurt you, may not be capable of acknowledging and understanding how you were affected by their actions - even in the worst of cases. they themselves may be doing what they can, either out of shame or heartbreak for their own actions, to work on forgetting how they behaved toward you all those years before. how are they behaving toward you now? can you find it in your heart to forgive those who have hurt you? forgiveness is the gift we give ourselves, and isnt dependent on an apology from an offender. by forgiving (even in the absence of any apology), we are releasing the weight of the burden we are carrying that reflects the offense we feel was committed against us. sometimes therapy can be helpful in this process. talking with someone who can be non-judgmental and reflects an empathetic position toward you might be what you need right now. seeking out a therapist to help you work through these negatives feelings and thoughts is much easier, than trying to go it alone. i would encourage you to reach out and find someone who resonates with you on that journey, so that you can begin a path toward healing.warm regards,shawn berthel, m.s., lmhc"

"i have bipolar ii disorder, im addicted to alcohol and weed, and im hopeless. i keep drinking even though its harming myself and others.","what an important question. im hearing your hopelessness and fear about the damage of your substance use and it sounds like you have reason for concern. while there can be negative stigma about using substances, for the most part substance use is an attempt to cope with emotional distress in the absence of sufficient coping strategies. we all look for comfort when we are in pain and this may be the way that you are getting comfort - even though it is also hurting you. in order to stop using alcohol and weed you will need a lot of support and you will need to learn other ways of getting comfort when you are in pain or struggling with bipolar related symptoms. there is nothing to be ashamed of and we all need help when we are struggling. i would encourage you to reach out for support in any way that you can. have you talked with your health care providers about your concerns or friends or family members? here are some links of resources in whistler that may be helpful:"
"last year, i just always felt hopeless. i dont have a great relationship with my sister. i lost my mother recently, and that really added to my sadness. my sister always brings up how i was never close to my mother.","i am so sorry about your loss. losing someone you love is always difficult, however, losing a mother is a significant loss in a daughters life. what makes this loss complicated is that it appears you have also had a loss in your relationship with your sister. it is difficult to know what happened with your sister with the limited information you have provided, but what i suspect is that there are some unresolved issues between the two of you and that she may be projecting her pain on to you. it is important to remember that your sister is also grieving the loss of your mother and may not be dealing with it in a very healthy way. by her bringing up your relationship with your mother and suggesting that you were never close to her is her opinion. only you can define and determine what your relationship was like with your mother. if there is truth to this, then it may be something you may need to talk about with a counselor. there could be an added layer of ambiguous loss in that you are not only grieving her physical absence, but could be grieving the loss of a relationship you wish you could have had with her and the realization that you never will. you and your sister are both in the heart of the grieving cycle. when two people are grieving the same loss at the same time, it is difficult to provide support to each other because of their own struggle, even if they both were on good terms with each other. depression is part of the cycle of grief. it is absolutely normal to feel sad, as well as experiencing other depressive symptoms (i.e., feelings of isolation, lack of motivation, low energy, sleep or appetite changes, etc.). anger is another phase of the grief cycle. your sister may be stuck in the anger phase, not wanting to connect with her own feelings of sadness, so this may be why she is being hurtful towards you, in projecting her anger onto you in order to avoid the vulnerability of experiencing her own grief.finally, it appears that your depression proceeded the loss of your mother and is making your experience with grief more complicated. were you officially diagnosed and treated for depression prior to your loss? depression in grief is different than a depressive mood disorder. depression can be situational (i.e., triggered by an event) or related to genetics, undiagnosed health issues, stress, trauma or other potential risk factors. if you have a family history of depression, you are more susceptible to have depression. it would be wise for you to discuss this with a mental health provider, and if necessary, get treatment through counseling and medical interventions."
"i was born a girl, but i want to be a boy. because of my religion i cant tell my family. i know they wont accept me. what do i do?","it is really important for you to be comfortable with your identity. with that said, it is also so important for you to be safe. it may be helpful for you to find supports (in your life, community, or online) that you can talk about how you feel and potentially gain supportive persons if your family does not accept you. it will be really important to connect with others and even a counselor to help you."

i have a friend that who i used to be in a relationship with. it was brief and turned into us being just good friends. i spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. was i wrong?,"thank you for submitting this question. i think this type of situation can be common for many couples struggling with how to keep friendships with past relationships while being in a new relationship. for me, more information is needed here...but given the information provided, the way i interpret the question is...im assuming your boyfriend didnt know you were going to spend the weekend with your good friend? working off of this assumption, i would suggest beginning an open and honest dialogue with your boyfriend about what specifically upset him? and to talk about your point of view regarding spending the weekend with him. i would also suggest talking about how you both envision your relationship when it comes to spending time with others. if you feel like you cant have this conversation without it going off track, please consider seeing a couples therapist. they can help you begin these important conversations that can help shape and develop the relationship you and your boyfriend long for."
"i told her that if daddy dies, we will never see him again. she started crying because i wouldnt make her daddy die.","children often have a difficult time expressing emotions accurately. it is also very likely that your daughter does not understand the permanence of death. having said that, she is using some very specific ideas here and i would recommend contacting a local mental health professional with some experience working with children.i would also wonder where she is getting this idea. sometimes children hear things on tv or from an adult and we are not even aware of how much they are remembering.it may be helpful to teach her things that she can do when she is angry, like say that she is mad because she cannot have the toy that she is asking for.im curious as to how long it is that she stays mad like this and whether she talks to her dad after she is no longer angry. does she say the same sorts of things about you?it may also be helpful for you to work with a mental health professional (possibly the same one who is working with your daughter) so that you can have some support with this as well."

"i have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.","something to remember about anxiety is that its a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. anxiety is our brains way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. the first id recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. try to be very specific, such as my palms are feeling very sweaty, and i can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies. then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible. combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful. if you feel that these techniques dont help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then id highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. this professional can help you determine if therapycounseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms."
im having trouble with my boss. theyre constantly micromanaging me and its making me feel stressed and anxious.,"it can be difficult to work with a micromanaging boss, but there are several things you can do to manage the situation. first, try to understand why your boss may be micromanaging you. are they lacking trust in your abilities, or are they under a lot of pressure themselves? once you understand their perspective, try to have an open and honest conversation with them about how their behavior is impacting you. set clear expectations for your responsibilities and deadlines, and offer to provide regular updates to alleviate their concerns. if the issues persist, consider speaking with hr or seeking a new job."

"i am a heterosexual male in my late 20s. i find myself wearing pantyhose, heels, skirts and other womens clothing in private. i am torn on how to feel about it. i enjoy it very much. i have had a pantyhosestocking fascination and other kinky fetish interests since i was young. i have no history of sexual abuse growing up. i am currently single.","hi there! it sounds like you have already started to answer your own question by stating that you love cross dressing very much, and i am glad you enjoy it! cross dressing is something many people enjoy, and there is no harm in it whatsoever. my question to you would be: what is making you feel torn about it? there is unfortunately still a lot of negative stigma associated with people who express their gender or sexuality in ways that differ from the majority. (and sometimes certain sexual interests are actually very common or even in the majority, but because people carry shame about being different when it comes to gender and sexuality we assume we are all alone!)being a sexual or gender minority or someone who participates in kink or expresses their sexuality or gender identity in a unique and personal way often means suffering from something called internalized oppression. we grow up being exposed to certain assumptions and beliefs about what is acceptable behavior and even face consequences sometimes if we dont fit in the way others tell us to. even if those assumptions are harmful and wrong, we still internalize them and feel guilty about who we are. there is nothing wrong with us, but feeling stigmatized and isolated can lead to feelings of shame, embarrassment, or like something is wrong with us.but there is absolutely nothing wrong with you, so be proud of who you are and what you enjoy. you can continue to simply enjoy it privately, or maybe youd eventually like to share it with a partner or maybe even join a community with similar interests. ill leave you with a quote from comedian eddie izzard, who identifies as, in his own words, a straight transvestite: theyre not womens clothes. theyre my clothes. i bought them! take care, and thanks for your question!"
how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"ideally, termination should be a mutual process. its not that the therapist kicks the client out at some point and says, okay, youre done. rather, over time the client will decrease the frequency with which heshe comes to session so that it may start off as weekly, then decrease to biweekly, then perhaps once every three weeks, then oncemonth and so on. throughout this process, the therapist and client should have had regular check ins about progress toward goals. if the client feels good about where heshe is in life, heshe might decide to suspend therapy for now. that being said, the therapist should make it very clear that if the client ever decided to return for maintenance therapy or a check in, heshe would always be welcome. there is no hard and fast rule to ending or a particular time period in which it must end. what matters most is that the client feels good about it and knows that the therapist will always be there should heshe wish to return."

i dont know what to say. i have never really known who i am.,"three years ago i attended a week long meditation retreat. by the fifth day i noticed i was light headed and felt very strange. i began to realize within my own being an experience of no separation. i would see others at the retreat and smile. i loved them all. i could feel the connection with this awareness i had read about but never truly understood until that moment. i remember understanding all the teachings i had learned throughout my life about a god who existed outside of me. i realized i had all these answeres within my own being and so did everyone else. i began to see everyone as not just capable but powerful loving beings. since this experience it has been my desire for everyone to become conscious within whatever experience they wish. i do this in many ways. at our studio we combine mental health with yoga and meditation as well as nutrition counseling to help people come to their optimal selves. to truly come into a state of finding yourself, is to start to know and own who you are from a state of solid being. in this there is nothing new under the sun, and it is very simple. i would love to teach you and anyone interested in coming into a state of awake conciousness. the more awake we are the more joyful we are. i live in this state of being and demonstrate it in my daily life."

"i have been with my husband for almost 7 years. we got engaged a little after 5 years of being together. i had always been clear that i wanted to get married and i sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose. when he did propose it was during a random vacation that i had planned. i was happy but i couldnt help feeling disappointed too. i had told him numerous times before that i wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family. i know it sounds dumb to be upset but i couldnt help how i was feeling. we are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what i wanted and it wasnt due to lack of funds. i know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but i cant help but get jealous and envious every time i see someone get a proposal or wedding that i had wanted. i cant help my anger because i know we only get one proposal and one wedding. what i wanted will never happen. i have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it. i try to focus on our marriage but every time i see someone have the best proposals and weddings i get upset. i know it is selfish and i know its petty but i just cant control it. its ruining our relationship because i constantly think about it. plus, i get mad at him for small things because i am trying to hide the fact that i am so disappointed. why cant i move on?","its hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement. this was something that you and most women think about for years, so its understandable to be disappointed. but please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect. you may envy your friends weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own andor it wasnt as perfect as they had planned it either. however, like you know, the marriage is the most important thing. how many women are envious that you are in a happy, stable relationship? i assure you that there are plenty. try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired. focus on what you can control now. perhaps, you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ring?i would also be upfront with your husband and explain why youve been short lately. but after that, close that chapter and move on. it sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly dont want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change."

"im in a relationship, but i feel like im always putting more into it and not getting reciprocated. my ex told me that i will never find anyone else, and thats lingering in the back of my mind.","the most crucial key to any relationship is that mutual feeling you hold between you both: that you matter. sounds like you are stuck in a cycle of hearing your ex say you dont matter. thats why it didnt work with him btw. he wasnt reflecting to you that you mattered. however it ended, clearly though thats the sentiment thats lingering with you. so here you are hanging around a new man why is telling you the same message. move on. you arent unworthy, you just havent found a man who is worthy of you! to be worthy of you, he must see your worth. often though before anyone else can see your worth, you have to believe it."

"about a month ago, i went through my boyfriends phone and found him messaging his ex-girlfriend that he was dating before me. he gave her a promise ring when they were together, and he still had it hiding in his memory box in our sons room. i found many things on his phone, but that broke my heart the most. he deleted all the messages but two. i cant help thinking they were talking about the old times together or something like that. it really kills me, and i cant stop thinking about it.","your sense of hurt is very understandable.do you and your boyfriend have an agreement on looking through each others phones?i ask because the overall problem sounds like lack of trust and that there may be a difference in what each of you wants and expects from your relationship.probably if the two of you talk about these topics and you each become clear as to the commitment status of each of you to the other, youll have more clarity as to what either of you would like from the other.with this new level of clarity, his past relationship involvements will likely be less meaningful .once you have clear definition of the two of you as a couple, who he was as a past partner to someone else, will matter very little."

"i have bipolar ii disorder, im addicted to alcohol and weed, and im hopeless. i keep drinking even though its harming myself and others.","the first step to change is to admit that you have a problem that is in need of change. frequently our problems keep us in denial. although feeling hopeless is an uncomfortable feeling, it suggests to me that you know that you can not do this alone. the best course of treatment for you is to treat all of these problems together. alcohol detox can be very dangerous so it is important that you do this under the supervision of a medical provider preferably someone who specializes in addiction. know also that although marijuana may not appear to be as big as a problem as alcohol is, it will cause you to have an increase in alcohol cravings so complete abstinence from drugs and alcohol is needed. i really recommend an inpatient stay for at least 30 days for anyone who is dealing with addiction, whether combined with mental health issues or not. if this is not a possibility, then the next best thing would be an intensive outpatient program that treats both addiction and mental health issues. know that there is hope for what you are experiencing. you can get control over these issues. the next step is finding the team andor facility that is going to help you do it."

does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"counselling offers a number of ways to help one to improve their situation. for some, this process can take a very long, winding path of self-discovery, while, for others, they are seeking a purposeful, solution-based way to approach and manage a specific problem. its important to remember that there are different styles of therapy, some of which will work great with some, but poorly with others, specifically to help those to decide how they wish to move forward. i often recommend speaking with a number of therapists before beginning treatment to find out more about how they practice, in order to make sure their style aligns with your goals. on a more specific note, there is myriad research out in the world that indicates both counselling and medication can have an affect on changing our moods and behaviours. however, medication is not an effective way of treating the problem, as it treats the symptoms of that problem (increased anxiety, lowered mood, etc.) and research has shown that the most effective route for better mental health care comes from a combination of counselling and medication."

i recently lost a friend to suicide. im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. how can i handle this better?,"first of all, i am very sorry for your loss, and i can understand the urge to drink and smoke to try and cope. as im sure you understand, alcohol and marijuana may take the edge off of the pain in the short run, but in the long run they may prevent you from being able to work through the thoughts and feelings that you have about the loss of your friend. grieving is a process that is unique to each individual and each relationship that may involve difficult, confusing, and even contradictory seeming thoughts and feelings and a competent therapist can help you work through this process. it also may be useful for you to add other ways of coping, such as taking care of yourself through exercise, doing healthy activities that you love, and spending time with people that you love. self care is often most difficult when we need it the most. thank you for reaching out."

"weve been together almost three years. we argue and he ends it by telling me he doesnt love me. its hurtful because i am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if i drop what hes done and just swallow my pride and say i am sorry. how can this be resolved? we have kids, and i dont want a broken family because we cant communicate.","under duress the very youngest parts of you and your boyfriend emerge. so, while you still look like grown ups, your actions and words are motivated by very early preverbal parts of both of you. in simple terms it is as if two infants somehow acquire the ability to say words but they are motivated by very basic early wounds that were created due to deficits in what was able to be done for each of you, and likely understandable in terms of caregivers life experience, and that still fell short of what you needed. you are both still trying to get very early needs met. the best advice i can offer is to try and remember this as early as possible when things start to heat up, and then restrain expression that you already know leads nowhere helpful. and seek out a therapist who can help you to work with these early issues and can support you to grow and develop from this stuck point.avraham cohen, ph.d, r.c.c., c.c.c."

"i have been with my boyfriend for more than a year. he recently got a new job and travels a lot. im not used to him being gone all the time. i feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesnt keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day, which he used to. i feel lost, sad and unwanted. this is really a tough new challenge. i just want to break up with him, but i love him so much. i dont know why he is acting this way lately. i believe i have separation anxiety. is there anything that i can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town?","in a way, yes, you have separation anxiety. its normal in a relationship for us to slow down a bit with the attachment behaviours that establish and deepen love and connection. so, just because your boyfriend isnt talking as much or keeping you up-to-date doesnt necessarily mean what you fear it means...that hes forgotten about you or loves you less. it could mean quite the opposite...that hes focused on being successful in his new job and impressing you. he may think hes loving you more, but you feel loved less. you have two jobs to do here. the first is to manage your anxiety by talking back to the thoughts it puts into your head. it sounds like its normal to be insecure, but i have tons of evidence that he loves me and that i mean the world to him... find that evidence that helps you refute what anxiety is trying to claim. the second part of your job is to let him know what you need. you need more affection and connection during this period when hes away (more texts, phone calls, information). its okay to want that, and i am sure he will be relieved to know exactly what he can do to help you feel secure and calm when hes away."

i loved him more than anything. he passed away on our anniversary which was also the day i was going to apply for our apartment. im not handling it well. i moved to a new town and started a new life but nothing helps.,"i am so sorry to hear of your boyfriends passing. grief is something that can take a long time to recover from. have you considered speaking with a grief counselor? being able to speak with someone that specializes in grief would be very beneficial. do not get down on yourself for not recovering quickly. this is one of the hardest aspects to deal with in life but eventually you will be able to move forward. in the mean time, immerse yourself with positivity (i.e. good friends, hobbies, exercise) and try to schedule a time with a counselor. perhaps there will be a support group you could also join. oftentimes, it is comforting to meet others who share the same experience as you.good luck to you. i hope you will find peace and comfort soon."

"i no longer carry expressions on my face, and my emotions are decreasing the more i have fights with my fiancée.","sometimes when we fight a lot with our partner, it becomes more uncomfortable to share emotions because it feels like it will lead to another flight or disagreement.you could try having a conversation when youre not fighting and starting it out by saying that you would like to discuss something important to you and see if your fiancée is open to that.something else is that you could have an agreement that if one of you is having a really strong emotions in a difficult conversation and would like to break from the conversation, you could agree (ahead of time) that youll say that you would like a timeout and will come back to discuss the issue in a certain amount of time (usually about an hour) and then try to resume the discussion. the reason this can work is it can give you a chance to calm down and then still go back to the discussion rather than not talking about it again. this only works if both of you agree to that before something starts, though."
"a lot of times, i avoid situations where i am to meet new people because i have a fear of embarrassing myself. i often avoid large groups of people, like parties, because i think they all constantly judge me.","why not accept and tolerate that you naturally are a shy person who doesnt like large groups?this is not necessarily something to get over if it is part of who you are.people have the capacity to judge others regardless of whether the group is large or small.if you arent afraid of being judged in small groups then study the factors which allow you to feel safe in small groups. possibly you can generalize your findings to large group venues.if you try the and arent successful, then likely you simply arent naturally someone who cares for large group settings.not everything a person doesnt like is a symptom of something is wrong w the person!"

"im in my early 20s, and ive been seeing my boyfriend for a year now. my boyfriend has always been the sweetest guy until recently. he has made comments such as you would look better as a tumblr girl or you should start doing more squats. its really hurtful.","hello, and thank you for your question. i am very sorry that you are experiencing this. to be honest, this kind of behavior is really emotionally abusive, and you likely know that already. the unfortunate truth is, there is very little we can actually do to change another adults behavior if they are not interested in changing it. many people who behave in this way actually feel justified in saying what they say, or even believe that they are helping in some way by telling you how to improve yourself. what is actually going on is an attempt to control or change something about you by being coercive and abusive. it is important to know that this kind of behavior doesnt necessarily show up right away. that is why i am not surprised that you are a year in to this relationship and are just now noticing these behaviors. some people actually dont see them until they are already married! you didnt mention that there has been any physical abuse, but i would warn you that this is sometimes a possibility once a person has already begun to be emotionally abusive. other things to watch out for is your boyfriend trying to control who you hang out with, what you do and how you dress, etc. these are just more examples of emotional abuse and control. here are some things to consider and some ideas:1. you could talk to your boyfriend about this behavior, if you believe it is safe to do so. perhaps he will recognize that his behavior is not okay, and change. if not, then you may need to decide what you want to do about this relationship, given the fact that you cannot force him to change. 2. you can call a local domestic violence program. they do not only work with people who have been physically abused or have been married. they are trained to talk about emotional abuse, also. it may be a good thing for support. your calls are confidential. 3. check out the wheel in the link below. on it you will find some other common ways that abuse can happen in a relationship. if any of these are happening to you, or begin to happen, talking to a domestic violence program, a trusted friend or family member, or a counselor would be a good idea. be well.... robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc"
"i was hanging out with my close guy friend. we started kissing, but afterwards, he said that we should just stay friends because he doesnt want to ruin anything. we both just got out of relationships. his was very sexual. im not a sexual person, and he knows that. i want to be with him, but im not ready for another relationship, and i dont know if he ever will want to be more than friends.","given that both you and your friend recently ended your respective romantic relationships, kissing each other sounds like each of you satisfied a very natural need which for right now does not has a natural source of satisfaction.suddenly being without a partner is difficult because a relationship absorbs and offers much of a persons energy. stay focused on what you know about yourself, which is that youre not ready for another relationship.from what you describe about your friend, similar to you, he does not feel ready for a new relationship.if and when you feel ready to enter a new relationship and your friend seems attractive, then youll be in a position to find out, either by approaching your friend as a potential partner, or by asking your question of his interest in you.who knows?it is possible your friend will feel ready for a new relationship, approach you, and depending on your personal wishes to be or not be with who he has become, accept his offer.good luck with step one, becoming familiar with your new state of single hood, and sorting through the good news and bad news of your most recent relationship."
"i have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor. they wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog, i have the paper work, and i gave it to my apartment manager. they said i cant keep the esd because im not disabled. what do you suggest i do?","this is tricky because there are different types of emotional support dogs. the ones that are officially trained actually go through months of training and then are paired with someone for whom they perform specific tasks.you may benefit from looking at the blog written by valerie parrott, who has an emotional support dog due to severe anxiety and panic. i will warn you that her blog is very blunt, but she is honest and she has gone through this process:"

"i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences. not a year ago, i had a car accident. could this experience add more problems?","a car accident can be a traumatic event. especially, if it was serious, you could have feared for your life, felt everythingvwas out of control and had normal reactions to an abnormal situation afterwards. this may or may not be related to the traumas that you experienced in the military. if it is then it is possible that you will see a direct effect in triggering off ptsd symptoms. even if it didnt, it is possible that the complexity of the two situations will interact inside you to be a combined response. having already been diagnosed with ptsd, this might be a good time to reconnect with the help system you had around military experiences and explore it a little bit about the new experience. the right exploration does not have to make things worse and can be a good source of prevention."

"my mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. she calls me every day complaining, but i dont want to hear it anymore.","this sounds like a possible boundary issue. boundaries are important in relationships. they are invisible lines that we will or will not cross. it is up to us to create and hold them. we have the ability to rethink them and change them as needed. it sounds like you have thought it through and would like to makes changes in the relationship between your mother and you. in the main question, you want to avoid the family member, however in the following comment, it sounds like you may just want the avoid that conversation, not so much your mother. once we review the issue and decide what we need (create the boundary), i suggest opening talking with the person when everyone is calm (not in the middle of a stressful moment when we often are unable to focus and hear the other person). always understanding that we had time to think about this issue and the other person has not (catching them off guard). state clearly your need. such as i am not comfortable with hearing about my sister. it stresses me out. i would appreciate it if you would not bring it up anymore. if you do, i will not respond and i will change the subject it is important to use i statements. i feel this way. i will do this. we only have power over our actions. also when we use you comments, the other person can become defensive and unable to hear what we are saying. once we let ourselves know what we need, then let the other people know our new boundary, then it is up to us to follow through. we will make mistakes. not follow through every time with our boundary. that is okay. start again. it gets easier with practice. it is also appropriate to reconsider and change your boundary as needed. just let the others know when you need to change it. remember, they can not read our minds. i wish you much strength and hope the best for you and your family."

"i have known i was always different. this year, in december, i found out that i never felt female. i did research and have identified myself as male but dont know how to tell my dad.","hello, and thank you for your question. this is certainly a tough spot. i have a few thoughts and perhaps some colleagues will add some things. you may want to spend a few minutes calling to mind any conversations that you have had with your father about transgender issues, or if you have ever heard him talk about it. that may give you a small clue about how well he may accept this news from you. for example, if he has been watching the news lately, transgender rights is something that is being talked about a lot. has he had an opinion? this wont tell you for sure if he would be okay with learning you are transgender, but at least you would know if there is hostility toward transgender people. to tell you the truth, the best way to tell your dad is whatever way feels right to you. there is no right or wrong way, best or worst. if you want to tell him when you are by yourself with him? thats perfect. want to have a friend with you for support? equally perfect. whatever thing you need to do. and, of course, there is always the option of not telling him anything until you are comfortable doing so. unfortunately, the response from your dad cant be predicted. some parents are totally cool.... others not so much. this is one reason why having someone with your for support is sometimes a good idea. if things get heated, you have someone in your corner. there are therapists who specialize in affirmative therapy, and they may be very helpful to you in working out how you want to tell him. you can also google some stories about how others came out.i refer many people to the blog. it is a popular blog written by a trans man that i know. he writes on many topics related to trans issues. hope some of these suggestions help. be well... be you.. and good luck!robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc"

"ive been going through a rough time lately. i been into nothing but women. ive never thought about men until a week ago. im very upset and depressed about this. its not normal to me. i looked at gay porn more than once to prove that im not gay. i get the same results each time, and i feel disgust. this is tough on me. im scared that i looked too many times. i keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","hello. coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be, can be emotionally disturbing, and quite unsettling. it creates anxiety, maybe even panic, and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity. it becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys, or if you desire them to be intimate with you. it is important to know what impact this has on you, because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex. i am not going to pass judgment on you either way - even for having the thoughts. i have worked with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (lgbtq) community in various ways over the years. many i speak to, say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually. maybe you are bisexual, and dont have an exclusive attraction to the same sex. you might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area, to explore the feelings and issues around this topic. talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too. running from your feelings is not a good idea, and others in a support group for sexuality issues, might be able to relate to you and what youre going through right now. this will offer you perspective, as you think on how this plays out in your life.counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now. i encourage you to consider reaching out for help. you are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor, nor of having feelings of same sex attraction. if you decide you are indeed gay, then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling. there is a huge community of support for you. additionally, we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues. a counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings, and help you come to terms with them more directly. i hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life. no matter what, do not fear being yourself. again...you are not alone, i promise.warm regards,shawn berthel, m.s., lmhc"
i find myself lying about small everyday things that there is really no need to lie about. how do i figure out what triggers me to do this? and how do i help overcome this problem? i would like to become more honest and open no matter the situation.,"well lets start with the awesome realization youve already had, you want to notice that you have triggers. thats huge. really. i find that when people lie, its most often as a defense mechanism. which is likely a flag that something doesnt feel safe. what exactly doesnt feel safe could be lots of different things but the key to notice is that its that feeling of insecurity that is very likely triggering you. it could really help to explore this with therapist, perhaps even someone with a trauma specialty -- thats not to say this is related to a trauma but more so to suggest that therapists specializing in trauma are very skilled at helping to identify and assist in repatterning your triggers!"
"i started having anxiety three months ago. im new to having anxiety, and its making me depressed.","as a past sufferer of anxiety myself, i have learned that it is a natural part of life, it is a natural part of us, the longer we try to run from it the more it entangles us in its clutches, if we deny certain parts of ourselves we will become depressed or even oppressed, the only way to deal with anxiety is to embrace it and accept it, and in fighting the fight without fighting we will eventually win, i would encourage you to look into acceptance and commitment therapy, your answer i think lies in that area of research. hope this helps,c"
my grandma had a stroke and passed away recently. i lost my home and job. im looking but havent found a job. ive been binge watching television and binge eating.,"hello!i write to respond to your recent inquiry for possible increase in self-esteem and positive behavioral change regarding motivation for a new job. first of all, please try to allow yourself some time for grief of the loss of your dear grandmother. it appears you were close to her in many ways and she had a great influence in your life. the grief process of anger, denial, despair and acceptance may be a part of what is keeping you feeling stuck in a cycle of not feeling motivated to find work at this time. perhaps your mind is constantly fighting this grief? death can be a traumatic experience for some people and is considered a great loss, thus the grief process may continue to be a part of your world for a time but hopefully not keep you stuck on a long-term basis. i would try to reach out to a counselor to discuss this grief process at a deeper level to discern whether her death is part of why you feel this way. grief and loss can also have an effect on your self-esteem. can you begin to see how this cycle is what you may be experiencing? one positive i see is that you are continuing to look for a new job! take time to give yourself some credit for the time you are spending looking for work. also, i would recommend you set some short-term goals first for example, make a list of 5-10 potential new employers and send them each your resume. then followup the next week with an email or phone call to make sure the hiring manager or human resources received your resume and have any questions. it is also a good idea to ask for informational interviews in order to get your foot in the door, so to speak.i hope that this information is helpful to you! please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.warmly,denise"

"i am an international student, and it is my first semester in graduate school in the united states. i faced a cultural shock, and i was so depressed when i arrived here. my counselor in the university was my savior. he helped me a great deal. now i am going back to my country for a vacation. i was thinking to get him something special with my countrys name on it, and i remembered that he likes wine. my country is known for that. is it appropriate to give him wine as a gift after christmas?","this is a great question. in general it is not appropriate for counselors to accept gifts from their clients. there are some exceptions to this general rule - including a recognition that there may be a valid cultural aspect to this type of gift giving.it might be best to simply offer your counselor a holiday card as an expression of your feelings. you could also talk to your counselor about the gift and ask if him it if would be appropriate.in the end, i know he would most appreciate just knowing how much the counseling meant to you."

"im always listening to my husband, but it feels like he never listens to me. how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time?","thanks for writing. there are many different house of things that may be helpful here. i can give you some general ideas, but if some of these things dont get you to where you would like to go, consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples:remember that you can only guarantee change in yourself. you can ask him to make changes, but you cant control whether he does or not. you can control your reactions and what you do about your own thoughts, feelings, and actions in the relationship.if youre going to talk about something important or you really want him to listen, first ask whether this is a good time.try to talk to him without blaming, finger-pointing, or asking him to change (this can be difficult, but it also opens a lot of doors for effective discussions).be mindful of your packaging. by that, i mean that you may have a very important message that youre trying to get across. if you able to say it in a way that is clear and wrapped in such a way that he can hear what youre actually saying, that is helpful. if you are talking in ways that are angry, or as i sometimes say, wrapped in spikes, that can be difficult to hear and receive. rather than hearing what youre actually trying to get across, he may just hear the fact that you are angry.if your husband is able to listen to you andor restate what you are saying and get it right or close to right, let him know what that feels like to you and how important it is.if youre asking questions, try to avoid why question and use what makes, how, when, where, who instead. questions starting with why can not only be difficult to answer, but can also trigger a lot of emotions that some people are not ready to deal with right away.also, keep in mind that listening and being able to reflect what you are saying does not imply agreement. this may be something that would be good to discuss with your husband just because he is hearing what youre saying doesnt mean that hes agreeing with you.lastly, but importantly, some people really dont know how to listen effectively. there are people who just are not taught to do that until much later in their lives. sometimes listening to someone can actually be very vulnerability-producing. it may be helpful to ask your husband if he knows what makes him struggle with being able to listen if you notice that hes really struggling."

"im in a long-distance relationship with my ideal man, but im not as attracted to him as i should be. everything else is perfect about him, but i find myself lusting over more attractive men. the next step is marriage, but i want to marry someone who i can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. however, i also dont want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. am i asking for too much in the perfect guy? is there such a thing? am i truly in love?","attraction is important but sometimes over-rated. im curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you should be - what is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship? do you want to be sexually intimate? do you enjoy having sex with him? are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him? the fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything. there will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a long-distance relationship far from the arms of your partner. loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men. attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance - including the degree to which you feel emotionally open, safe, and connected and how in tune you are with each others bodies. it sounds like you think very highly of this man everything else is perfect about him. maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love."

how do you know you have the right therapist for you? how would i know how to train my therapist to be able to give me what i need from treatment?,"when you find the right therapist, you will feel understood on a deeper level. youll feel that they not only understood what you were saying, but that they were also able to catch the in between the lines part and put into words what you have not been able to. the relationship with your therapist should be collaborative, there should be a fundamental element of safety and trust. a strong relationship with your therapist takes time to cultivate, but by the second or third session, youll know if that therapist genuinely sees the world from your perspective and has a plan to get on how they will support your growth through this journey."

"my son stole my debit card and lied about it. its not the first time he has lied. i dont know what to do anymore. i dont know if i should punish him or make him do something. ive tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. i have grounded him, but nothing works. what should i do?","hi enid, you sound like a sensitive parent i like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong. there is some key information here (i dont know your sons age, whether he spent any money, whether he put the card back, or how many times hes stolen), and my answer might be different depending on those details, but ill give you my thoughts.i see it as every childs job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world. in order to accomplish that, many of them test limits. what can i get away with? is a question they have to find the answer to. if a child knows the rules, theyre much more likely to not test limits (because they already know the limits). so, part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying. not all kids steal, but i would say pretty much every child lies at some point. its a normal behaviour, and most of the time its about small things that dont matter and we dont even find out. stealing a debit card is a bit more serious, and im not surprised he lied about it. if you absolutely know that he took it, its okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it. its appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour, so that the child doesnt do it again. the consequence should be as natural and logical as possible. the behaviour (stealing) was harmful to you, so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea. its funny, because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad, but they know theyll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest (we dont want people to know our mistakes). its a dilemma. if you really want to focus on the lying part, you can tell him that you wont give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day. that gives him incentive to come to you with truth. it sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth. you can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty. put a cookie on the counter. tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day. then ask them later if they took the cookie. youre making honesty fun. kids love games. basically, theres as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative. if this is the first serious offence for your son, dont make a big deal of it consequence him and see if he learns. if its a pattern, thats different and you may want the input of a therapist."
im feeling overwhelmed and stressed all the time.,stress and overwhelm can be taxing on both your mental and physical health. lets explore potential triggers and identify strategies to help you manage your stress in a healthy way that supports your overall well-being.
how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"to be able to identify a clear ending to a counseling relationship, we must have a clear understanding of the goals and limitations of treatment. usually, during the initial evaluation, i identify my clients short term and long term therapy goals. as therapy progress, we verify goals on a monthly to a quarterly basis, depending on the frequency of the appointments. once the therapy goals have been met, there is a closing session, the counseling relationship is ended, and the client can stop attending sessions. in some cases, the client can also establish new goals and determine if i am a good fit for their therapy needs or if they need a new provider, in which case i provide multiple referrals.the counseling relationship could also end due to other factors like noncompliance when a client is not committed to the agreed treatment process, or when the clients or a counselor violates the counseling relationship. either the counselor or the client is able to end counseling. although, as mental health providers we need to provide a reason for terminating our therapeutic relationship and referral options, as a client no explanation is needed, a closing session is highly recommended. cómo termina la terapia?cómo un consejero decide cuando terminar las sesiones de consejería o terminar de trabajar con un paciente?para poder determinar el final de la relación del consejero, debemos comprender las metas y parámetros de la terapia. usualmente durante la evaluación inicial se identifican metas a corto y largo plazo con el cliente, y se discute con el cliente como esas metas serán alcanzadas. durante el proceso de terapia el consejero revisa las metas mensual o trimestralmente dependiendo de la frecuencia de las citas. ya que las metas de terapia son alcanzadas, hay una sesión de cierre y el cliente puede terminar la terapia. en algunos casos el cliente puede identificar nuevas metas para la terapia y determinar si el mismo consejero u otro consejero le pueden asistir. la relación de consejería también puede terminar por no conformar o violentar los parámetros establecidos para la terapia. tanto el consejero como el cliente pueden terminar la relación de terapia. como proveedores de salud mental los consejeros estamos obligados a proveer un razón para la conclusión del tratamiento y proveer referidos según aplique, los clientes no necesitan proveer una explicación, aunque es recomendable discutirlo en una sesión de cierre."

"i was the one who ended it, and im so glad i did. it was the best decision i made in my life. but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks? it is creating a wall in my current relationship.","one thing you could try to do on your own is to focus on the partner who is in front of you now. if you are able to connect with them via touch or focusing on their tone of voice, that may help to center you. tried to stay grounded andor mindful. that is being aware of your position in the room, your feet on the floor, your hands in your lap, or your hips in the chair. being mindful of the environment you are currently (for example, noticing what is around you) may be helpful. try to use all your senses. for example, you could focus on hearing your husbands voice, feeling his hand in yours, being wrapped in your favorite blanket, seeing a comforting photo, using a comforting sense or candle, or tasting an apple that reminds you of times when you have enjoyed yourself in the kitchen.it also sounds like you are having a very specific reaction that could very well be related to trauma. i would recommend that you talk with a local mental health professional.remember, just because it was the best decision of your life, that doesnt mean that what happened to you or in your presence automatically leaves you when you leave the relationship. our brain is actually hardwired to remember things that have caused us pain or great emotional distress as a way of protecting us from them happening again. this is a very natural response and the reactions you have as far as nightmares and flashbacks are the past coming forward and your brain trying to make sense of it all."
"when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. she is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but i am afraid she is stressing too much. im afraid its going to break her. i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.","oh dear - this is becoming all too common. i suggest you have some conversations with your girl to figure out where she is getting the information that she builds anxiety around. i see teens who have heard teachers, parents, coaches, etc push the highly selective colleges idea on kids way too much. teens in particular are prone to black and white thinking, leading them to see one poor test performance, one off day, one not-great assignment as the make-or-break task on the path to successful adulthood. if thats the case with your daughter, she needs you to help modulate both the incoming information (there are nearly 5000 colleges in the us - she will get into one of them!) as well as her reaction to that information.as well, you and any other adults that are involved in parenting her need to discern fact from fiction. the recent scandal around celebrities buying their kids into college is an indicator of how far off track we, as a culture, have gotten in terms of education. a college education is certainly important, but we have allowed the marketing push to create so much stress and upset for our kids (and ourselves as parents) that they are actually less prepared to leave home and really engage in higher education than ever.you may want to include a therapist in these conversations if you get stuck, but start with a parent-child conversation. help her figure out what is going on - if it is the i have to get it right or i will have no future, calmly walk her through all the evidence that says thats just not true. as well, let her know that being anxious now is not preparing her for a bright adulthood - its preparing her for an anxious future. she needs help figuring out how to balance her effort to attend to real and reasonable expectations, not over-inflated fear-based actions."

i am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships. how can i fix my underlying issues?,"hi there. its great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. at the root of it is fear. fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. all those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you dont lose them. the thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. vicious circle, right? what i would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. you can start with this assignment. write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. for example, thinking something like, im too pushy, can be rewritten as, im assertive and i go after what i want. it can be hard to do since we tend to get stuck in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. if you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if thats not an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites that are out there. youve already taken the first step, so keep moving forward."
"ive never been able to talk with my parents. my parents are in their sixties while i am a teenager. i love both of them but not their personalities. i feel that they do not take me seriously whenever i talk about a serious event in my life. if my dad doesnt believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesnt believe me either. im a pansexual, but i cant trust my own parents. ive fought depression and won however, stress and anxiety are killing me. i feel that my friends dont listen to me. i know they have their own problems, which i do my best to help with. but they dont always try to help me with mine, when i really need them. i feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. i feel as if i have no one whom i can trust.","first of all, i am sorry that you have been missing out on your childhood. it may help you to know that many of us feel that we have missed out on our childhoods, as well, and that despite such deprivations, for many of us, our adult lives have been extraordinarily fulfilling due to our opening up to trusted adults. i recommend that you find a trustworthy adult to talk to. this may be a teacher, a coach, a school counselor, a minister, a family member, or a friends family member. if none of these are available, try out a professional counselor, social worker, psychiatric nurse practitioner, psychologist, or a psychiatrist. it is best to get a referral for such a professional from a peer who has had a positive and safe experience with a particular provider."

"i have suffered many things at home and school. we never went to the doctor to diagnose depression or anything like that, but i always feel like a part of my heart is missing. i try to fill it in with objects or, in this case, a woman.","there could be many reasons but often people feel validated when they are in a relationship, the need to be in a relationship can be related to a belief of unlovability which often stems from our childhood. the relationship sort of soothes this temporarily and the others interest or desire helps counteract the ingrained belief. there are many questions that may help understand why, how was your relationship with your mother (caregivers)? how was your childhood etc.? many people describe having a hole or void they try and fill with material things or people but it only is a temporary fix which usually drives the person to the next relationship, or object in hopes it will be fulfilling but it never is because fulfillment is work we need to do ourselves. this journey involves finding acceptance and love for ourselves. once we have that we dont need to look elsewhere for fulfillment."

i hate everything i see in the mirror. i dont like being in pictures and always scribble out my face. its stressing me out. i dont trust my parents enough to tell them and i dont know what to do.,"this is so very common in this crazy looks-obsessed world! i meet so many beautiful people who cant see their beauty. is there something getting in the way for you? was there a time in your life when people teased you or told you something hurtful, or did something to you that made you feel ugly? if so, this can be addressed first. sometimes stories are told about us when were young and the best thing we can do is see the authors evil or careless intent and not take that on. a therapist can help you with this part.once youve addressed any past barriers to feeling confident, you can focus on a few simple things. first, your thoughts. if you keep telling yourself that you dont like what you see, then you will never feel okay about your looks. experiment with telling yourself something different. look in the mirror and i dare you to find something thats lovely about your face. focus on that. describe what you see? if you were your own best friend, what would you say about your face? eliminating those negative scripts and building new positive ones will help you feel more accepting of how you look. you cant change your face, but you can change your attitude towards your face. confidence is the things that will make you beautiful!accepting how you look is important. without going to plastic surgery (the popularity of which is a testimony to how nuts this whole thing has become), you were born with that nose, those eyes, those lips. accepting yourself and knowing it wont change is a good idea, because wishing it were different wont make it so!looking good is also about minimizing flaws and building on your assets. are you in a rut about hairstyle or makeup? ask a good friend to give you a make-over. play with your features and wardrobe. there are plenty of average looking people who know how to make themselves shine because they are creative!"

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"hi there, there are a number of reasons why a therapeutic relationship might end including, but not limited to the client reaching their goals, the client reaching a place of acceptance where they wish to remain or even a breach within the relationship. the last aspect should likely be taken to supervision in order to be fully processed. all of these things could happen, and usually happen organically (again, except for the last example). your question, however, was about the counselor ending treatment. this is a bit more difficult and can be very nerve-wracking. it may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision, as well. its important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client, as well. do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist, have they achieved their goals or is it something else?in regular, open-ended sessions, i try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently. in these check-ins, i use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely. i also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize. in goal-oriented sessions, i check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and i remain focused and, should they wish to shift their focus, that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goal. often, especially in longer term therapeutic relationships, we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal, however they are apprehensive about ending therapy. this is actually a great place to go with them why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you? often, having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery. that said, it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now, as the relationship seems to be ending, feels more confident in bringing these up. in the case where the relationship is a toxic one, terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you. its a difficult conversation, but recall that part of the role of the therapist is to model that these discomforts can be managed. i hope that this brief response can assist you going forward!"

"i am going through a divorce from a narcissistic sociopath who left me for another woman after mentally and emotionally abusing me for 11 years. i have moved to a different state and after giving up my successful business am working as a server at a restaurant. im coping as best as i can. is it normal and healthy to not adapt as quickly and be as strong as i think i should be? i am astounded at his cruelty and how much he doesnt care, as well as most other people in my life. i feel like i dont exist to anyone anymore as there is no contact from anyone who i thought cared about me. my brother just said no to lending me a few hundred dollars for me to live on. i am losing faith in humanity itself.","i am very sorry to hear of your struggles. i think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce, especially after leaving a relationship that lasted 11 years, so try not to be too hard on yourself. take it one day at a time and do the best you can.i notice that you said he left you. this tells me that you didnt have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you. low self-esteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they cant do any better. also, abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get. the way i see it, he did you a favor. you are now free to make your own life whatever you want it to be. take this time alone to work on you. as hurtful as it may be that other people dont want to help you, this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you. your statement i dont feel like i exist anymore tells me that in addition to low self-esteem, you also dont have a clear sense of identify and rely on the people in your life to help define who you are. people can and will let you down. it is important for you to learn to handle disappointment, learn to take care of your own needs, and to gain a stronger sense of self. do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it. even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath, do something that makes you feel good. find a hobby that you enjoy. look in the mirror and tell yourself some positive affirmations daily. google positive affirmations to find some that resonate with you. such statements might be i am a good person who deserves to be happy or i can do this. some relaxation and meditation exercises may help you as well. there are some free meditation exercises that you can find online by doing a simple google search.take this time to focus on you and try not to worry about what everyone else in your life is doing. when you are a happier, more stable person, the right people will come into your life without you even looking for them. good luck with rebuilding your life. i know it is hard! remember to take it one day at a time."

now i have anger and trust issues. how can i treat this and fix myself?,"i will assume that for whatever reason, you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this. however, i highly urge you to do so because long-term childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult, as it seems you are already aware. there are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse. somemost also offer free counseling services in local areas. that would be a good place to start looking, especially if cost of counseling is an issue.the important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past. having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you. angry? yes! at your brother for what he did, at your parents for not protecting you. having trouble trusting? of course! the very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead. two books that might help you are codependent no more and boundaries: where you end and i begin."
"i have been with my best friend for over a year, and we have had a beautiful baby girl. we were in love, and i still love her dearly. i am in my late teens and so is she. she says she has lost her connection with me. she is talking to a random guy that she says is just someone to talk to. but she says she still loves me. im very hurt and confused.","congrats on having your daughter!have you told your partner about your feelings of hurt and confused?this is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together, in light of the change in emotional connection.the first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling, what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner.ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics. then, allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other.this is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused.it is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply.if the conversations dont go very far, or if your partner has no interest in talking, stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters.interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation."

"my mom and i have been fighting a lot now, and i just want a good relationship with her.","the best way to work on a relationship is for both people to engage with the problem and start communicating with each other more effectively. one of the hardest things about this, however, is getting both people within the relationship to recognize that they are both responsible for the successes and failures within the relationship and remove all the all-or-nothing blame. the best style of communication is open and asking for clarification why not try asking your mother why this particular fightsituation is eliciting such an angry response. often, the simple act of expressing that we dont understand the other persons point of view can open the doors to better levels of communication. the hardest part is trying to remain humble as we seek out that clarification and avoid the blaming language we are so used to using in such times."

i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes. how can i start accepting myself and be more confident?,"the most important word here is sometimes. i know it is quite painful, and i can imagine that at times this pain doesnt feel like it will subside. but it sounds like it is not all the time, which means we can easily say that this hate myself experience is one part of you. there are many other parts, if you give them some space to also speak up, that will offer you more positive regard, trust me on that. generally speaking, we just dont know how to listen to those parts, because......it is the i hate myself part that is our inner critic. and often, our inner critic has developed a lot of strength throughout our life because of how weve depended on it for certain things. sounds crazy, but in actuality, some of the most successful people, in work mainly, are those that have strong inner critics. they use these critics to motivate themselves, but with people, and in relationships, and in our relationship with ourselves, it completely backfires, because relationships are far more dynamic processes than doing well at work.so, try to acknowledge that the inner critic is one part of you, that youve learned to give a lot of space to. but, if you sit with even a remotely positive feeling you have, it can also be given the space to speak up and grow, just like the critic has over time."

i want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it. i seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. i let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. i let men emotionally abuse me and i am at their beck and call. i am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. i feel i need the security of someone being around just to survive. i know what im doing wrong and i do it anyway just hoping things will change. how do i stop this behavior and thought process?,"it is a good thing that you have recognized that you have been in some unhealthy relationships and that you are wanting to break this pattern. you seem to have some good insight into the situation.the type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers, childhood trauma andor abuse or neglect, or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self. this is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy. i recommend a book titled boundaries: where you end and i begin by anne katherine. another book that might be helpful is codependent no more by melody beattie. in the meantime, until you can work through your personal issues, absolutely do not enter into another relationship. take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole, happy, emotionally healthy person on your own. needing another person to define you is problematic. thats too much to expect from any individual.for a relationship to be healthy and happy, both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own. that means having a clear sense of self, knowing who you are and what you want, knowing how to set healthy boundaries, and knowing how to meet your own needs. it is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time. there will be times that they wont be able to meet your needs. you have to know how to meet those yourself. when you are working on becoming the best you that you can be, eventually the right person will come into your life. then you can choose to be with someone because you want them in your life instead of feeling like you need them to complete you."

"i am lazy. i am very aware of the problem and try to talk myself out of it all the time, but i never seem to shake the habits. i try to think of what it is doing to me and my future, but no matter what, i keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination. all im ever left with is regrets and a low grade. i am at an all-time low in my life, and im not even that old. ive always been a straight-a student, but now im getting cs and fs, and it hurts me to know that i am way better than that. its not even like the work is hard.","i am sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough time. it sounds to me like you are suffering from depression to some degree. have you seen a therapist or talked to anyone about your problems? if not, i would advise that you do so sooner than later so that you can learn what is causing you to be unmotivated and causing difficulty with breaking the cycle that you are in. it is also a good idea to get a medical evaluation from your doctor to rule out any medical causes for your current condition. most often, difficult situations that life throws at us, along with an inability to think positively, and break bad habits are what cause depression. some things you can do immediately are seek help from a professional, schedule in time every day to engage in pleasurable (or once pleasurable) activities, exercise daily, and practice thinking more positively. set a few daily goals for yourself and write them down each morning or the night before. achieving your goals every day will give you a sense of accomplishment and can lead to feeling more optimistic and capable. additionally, keep a journal to write down how you are feeling and what ideas you have to help feel better. sometimes having these ideas written down make it more real and tangible. know that depression is most often curable but takes work and a desire to change (which you clearly have). once you start feeling better about yourself and your life, your grades should naturally begin to improve, as you will have more motivation and energy to focus on that particular area. best of luck to you!"

i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit. i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. i was very embarrassed.,"first of all, congratulations to you on becoming a water safety instructor.as far as how to forgive yourself, this is probably one of the toughest things that we ask of ourselves, no matter the subject. on the other hand, it sounds like the location of the mistake means that after you get through the class, you wont see the same people much longer, so hopefully the embarrassment will be temporary.as far as the class, maybe you can give yourself compassion for the idea that we all make mistakes and it certainly sounds like it wasnt intentional. i think we have all had a swimsuit shift in unwanted direction.trying to make sure that the same thing doesnt happen again would probably be helpful, but it sounds like you are already doing that. something else you could do is think of something you can say to yourself when someone says something embarrassing about that occurrence, such as it was an accident and i have fixed it now.you may find some helpful tips here or here . these are not meant to be resources related to religion, but it is mentioned in a few places."
"we live with my ex-partners sister and her husband. we have been there for five years now. they are hispanic and talk to my daughter in their language. sometimes they overstep their balance between aunt and uncle and reach into my role as a parent. they neglect to see this. i do, and it reflects in my childs behavior. she sees them as stable but is upset that her dad isnt here, and my intuition tells me she blames me to a degree because she doesnt know about his alcohol addictions.","hi new york, im happy to hear that your daughter doesnt know about her dads addictions. although you dont say how old she is, and i imagine that at some point in her life she will be ready to know the truth, i trust your instinct that now is not the time. your ability to have clear boundaries about what is adult conversation and what is suitable for a child to know are really important here, and i can tell youre being appropriately protective and a thoughtful parent. as much as this helps your daughter, i sense that you also know you cant take away the emotional pain that comes from having an absent parent. children tend to blame themselves for a parents absence. these children need extra love and support wherever they can get it.you say that you feel like there is a wedge between you and your daughter. i understand that having your ex partners relatives in the same home would make it uncomfortable at times. it is very important to establish boundaries only you should parent your daughter, but its also natural for people to want to assist you. lets trust that their intentions are good, if there is no evidence to the contrary. as much as they support you, they also have emotional ties to your daughters father. while there is potential for discomfort in this complex situation, there are also many positive factors here that i invite you to see.i dont know what your culture is, but for your daughter to have the opportunity to preserve her fathers heritage language and a relationship with his family are potentially wonderful additions to her life. in general, the more adults around loving and supporting a child, the better. it could be that you are feeling threatened by small moments where there appears to be a special connection between your daughter and her fathers family. nothing anyone else does can take your daughters love from you. my hope for you is that you can feel so secure in your own position as loving mother that you will not feel intimidated by other positive connections your daughter has. they are potentially wonderful connections, and she deserves your support in maintaining those relationships if they dont harm her.i suggest that the most important alliances to work on here are between you and your exs family. if you could all give your daughter the gift of a healthy, united supportive and loving safety net for her...thats the best outcome of all."
im feeling really anxious lately and i dont know why.,anxiety can be caused by a variety of factors. lets explore what might be contributing to your feelings of anxiety and work on developing coping strategies together.
"i have so many issues to address. i have a history of sexual abuse, im a breast cancer survivor and i am a lifetime insomniac. i have a long history of depression and im beginning to have anxiety. i have low self esteem but ive been happily married for almost 35 years. ive never had counseling about any of this. do i have too many issues to address in counseling?","you definitely dont have too many issues for counseling. in fact, counseling can help you understand how most of these things can be related to one another. for example, insomnia, depression, low self-esteem and anxiety are very common to experience after a traumatic event or events. once you begin to work through processing these life altering events that you have experienced, the hope is that you would see a decrease in your other symptoms."

"often times i find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes i even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and i cant get it out. how can i stop these thoughts?","such a great question! im so sorry you are struggling! you may be experiencing intrusive thoughts. these are thoughts that seem to come from no where and victimize us. i can strongly recommend a book called when panic attacks by dr. david burns. it helps you to identify the thoughts, and the help you create ways to counteract them! there is another technique, called thought stopping. thought stopping can be as simple as saying stop! loudly (if you are alone) or in your head, if you are in public. its a quick way to distract you from the distressing thought, and allow you to refocus. i recommend using this technique, followed by some deep breathing, while visualizing something that helps you feel relaxed (a favorite place, a pet, etc.). these three things in conjunction can be of great assistance. one key component in addressing anxious thinking is building the skill of relaxation. i recommend an app called headspace which teaches relaxation through some simple guided mediation. super easy to do, and a great way to begin to build relaxation skills. plenty of sleep and reducing caffeine intake can also be things to explore. hope this helps!"
im having problems shutting them out and putting up walls.,"it sounds like you would like to let other people get close to you and at the same time you are finding yourself compelled to keep people at a distance. often times, when we have difficulty trusting others, it is because we have specific fears about what would happen if we get close or let our guard down. such fears may be rooted in past experiences in relationships in which we were hurt and or disappointed. in working with a therapist, you can gain insight into what is underneath your compulsion to put walls around yourself and develop ways to form authentic, lasting, satisfying relationships with others."
"the eight months ive been dating my boyfriend, i have lied about a lot of things. i slept with a couple guys to get back at my boyfriend for breaking up with me. now anything i say to him he wont believe, even if im being honest. i dont know what else to do at this point. he constantly criticizes me.","start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trust.ask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you again.if you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust, and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you, then after a few months of this, both of you should feel more secure in the relationship."

ive been having a hard time with body image lately. i feel like i am constantly judged for my appearance and its making me feel very self-conscious. what can i do to feel better about myself?,"its important to remember that everyone has flaws and imperfections. focus on your strengths and positive attributes, rather than dwelling on your perceived flaws. surround yourself with people who love and support you, and try to avoid comparing yourself to others. engaging in activities that bring you joy and boost your confidence can also help improve your body image. lastly, consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your feelings and develop healthy coping mechanisms."
"im always told im not good enough or trying hard enough. i put 100 in to every thing. im worn out, ive worked on all of my family relationships, im doing great in school, im kind to those in need and otherwise. i stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so i dont have to make as many and the ones i do i learn from. somehow its still not good enough and nothing i do works. nothing has changed, and i feel hopeless. any suggestions or ideas?","hello, and let me say first, what a great question! there are so many people putting forth their 100 everyday and often times, do not get the credit they deserve. without being able to fully understand where youre question is coming from, i think there are a couple of different ways to look at this question.first, i think its important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that youre not good enough. is that actually what they said, or is this just what you heard? sometimes, because of our own self-doubts and fears, we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others. again, listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective. is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern? if so, have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time youre spending on being good enough. explore with them how you feel your already giving your best.if the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have, then it may be time to explore the relationship. some relationships we engage in can be toxic, especially if the other person is toxic. it may be they have their own stuff going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better. if youre in the direct path of this individual, then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire, as well. explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life. if its a relationship that must continue, then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems. until theyre willing to work on these issues for themselves, then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy, such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation. another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why its important for you to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals? no one will ever be 100 good enough for everyone. every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others. it would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives. the question becomes, what is it within you that feels the need to meet these expectations? there is most likely a part of you, yourself, as an individual that feels less than and feels as if you, yourself, are not good enough. it then becomes impossible to every feel good enough for others, because its really you youre trying to feel good enough for. if you already feel as if youre doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself, then really work on letting go of the rest. no one is perfect, and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress. find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals, and learn to let go of whats left. after all, tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrow!i recommend doing this by finding a mantra, a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection. the mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation. i leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra, no one can make you feel inferior without your consent. - eleanor roosevelt."

every winter i find myself getting sad because of the weather. how can i fight this?,"there can be lots of different factors contributing to this. here are some possible tips:consider if you know anything about what specifically is making you feel sad? if youre looking for activities because you cannot participate in what you like to do in the warmer months, consider finding some indoor winter activitiesconnect with others. one idea is to join a group (such as a book club) that meets regularly. this could give you something to look forward to regardless of the colder weather.enjoy the sunshine from indoors. you may notice that sometimes looks are deceiving women is bright and sunny outside, but is also quite cold when you open the door. if you are staying inside for the day, consider allowing yourself to enjoy the sunlight without specifically considering that it is also cold.consider using a light box. certain types of light boxes are designed to help with the winter blues. you can find more information here: one of the nurse practitioners that i work with has been checking a lot of vitamin d and vitamin b12 levels and she says the lower levels of these vitamins can contribute to feelings of less motivation or energy than is desired.each of us has days when we are not thrilled about the weather and may be feeling sort of bummed or down. if you find yourself having these days frequently or for several consecutive days in the above strategies are not helping, consider talking with a therapist about more specific strategies that may be of help to you. also, because if everything you would see is likely to live in your area, they would be familiar with the weather patterns where you are and may have some tips that they use for themselves or with other clients."

"after i told them, they yelled at me.","hello, and thank you for your question. i am very sorry that this was your experience with your family. i truly wish i could give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction, but unfortunately i cant do that. their acceptance of you is a journey, just like coming out is a journey for you. sometimes families initially respond this way, but after time they become more accepting and even supportive. unfortunately, there is no way to know for sure if that will happen. so, here are a few things i would suggest:surround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are. that wont take the place of your familys acceptance, and i wont even pretend that it would, but it may help during those days when it hurts the most. and that is really important. patience is not something that many of us are really good at, but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some. when families first learn something like this, they may go through a period of shock. and then sometimes even grieving. they may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden. these things can take time for them to reconcile, so it may just take some patience. if it is safe for you, try to talk to them, but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away. i do recommend setting up some personal boundaries for yourself, and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them. the reason i feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like youre describing. they may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around. they may, or they may not. and if they dont, you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are. to be surrounded by folks who remind you of that. if you start seeing this pattern and you are struggling, chatting with counselor may be a great idea. i am bias probably, but i think chatting with a counselor is always a good idea. :) hope this helps. be well. be you. robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc"

"i know that i need to get past my feelings for this person i fell in love with, but ts so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings ive never felt before. i feel like i dont want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, i know i need to be without him. i cant discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered wrong by a lot of people. how can i get myself to just move on?","well, there is some good news and not-so-good news. the good news is that people are capable of moving on from relationships, even if the person showed them a sort of love that theyve never felt theyve had, or deserved, before. sometimes, even just the fact that this has happened for them can, eventually (see below) lead them to seek out love again, because they now believe they will be able to have that again.so, the not-so-good news though is that one can not just move on. id even venture to say that the pressure you may be putting on yourself to just move on and out of this yucky hole of feelings that you are in is actually too much pressure and adding to the yucky feelings as they are. instead, try thinking of getting past these feelings as grieving over the loss of someone (even though someone didnt die, there is still a significant loss you are experiencing) and therefore how essential it is to allow yourself to grieve, to feel whatever feelings (of anger, or sadness, or something else) that you are feeling. often, it is really helpful to speak those feelings (i recommend professionals in this case) who can help you feel like you are not pathological for this struggle, and instead that it is completely normal. love is a crazy thing, and the feelings can get very confusing. but, the last stage of grieving is acceptance, and it is very challenging to get there if you skip over denial, anger, bargaining, and depression."

"im currently struggling with diagnosed depression, anxiety, and misophonia. also, i am 99 sure i have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder. i read the dsm-iv, taken college psychology, etc. i know it in my heart i have them. is self-diagnosing okay with the right research?","hello, and thank you for your question. self-diagnosing is something that we all do about one health issue or another. taking a guess about what may or may not be happening to us is completely normal, however the actual clinical diagnoses of a mental health disorder requires a licensed mental health professional. here are a few reasons for this: 1. making a clinical diagnosis often requires other things besides matching up the symptoms of a disorder. to come to a diagnoses for any of the things you mentioned, a counselor would consult the dsm, but they may also use some type of screening tool, assessment or scale. many disorders have similarities and it requires someone with training to tease out the differences in the symptoms. 2. our judgement is sometimes off when it comes to assessing ourselves. we really cant be objective. something as serious as determining a diagnosis really needs to be done by someone who has that objectivity. in addition, once you know your diagnosis, treating it usually requires help from a professional. 3. sometimes the symptoms of a mental health disorder makes self-diagnoses impossible, in and of itself. for example, someone could be having hallucinations or delusions and not realize it. that would clearly make it impossible for them to diagnose themselves. there a many examples where something like this could happen with different mental health disorders. there are other reasons, but these are three important ones. now, does this mean that you are wrong about your diagnosis? maybe not. you may be correct. but, it is important to get this confirmed by a professional mental health clinician. if a disorder is then found, you can begin to talk about treatment. hope this was helpful. be well.robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpcc, ncc"

i feel like my life has no purpose. i dont know what to do.,"it sounds like youre struggling with feelings of existential angst. many people go through periods like this, and its completely normal. together we can explore your interests and values to find direction and meaning in your life."
"i am not sure if i am depressed. i dont know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.","you are not alone, many people fear opening up to family members about the topic of depression or mental illness. there are many different reason why some may fear telling their parents. the most common thoughts i hear in my office are: my parents wont understand me, i may cause more problems to the family, i am worried that something bad may happen if i tell them. if possible express your current concerns and worries to your parents. you can start the conversation with your parents by saying i have not been feeling like myself lately, and i may want to see a counselor. i think you are doing the right thing by going on this website and asking for help. just a helpful tip: positive self-talk can be beneficial before having difficult conversations with others. for example, tell yourself something positive before talking to your parents such as i feel confident in myself, and i am doing this to overcome my fear of talking to my parents can help to decrease the anxiety you are feeling leading up to the conversation. i would recommend if you are feeling depressed or down it would be beneficial to seek counseling to understand your current thoughts and behaviors. best of luck and hope you decide to start counseling."
"my husband used a lot of negative words to hurt me, and i moved out. he is seeing a counselor and wants another chance to make things right. im not sure if i trust that he will not go back to his old ways.","i am glad he is seeing a counselor. that is something that most men struggle with doing at times. time will tell if his actions are of good intentions. however remember that a person can only do to you what you allow them to do in relationships. what part did you play? did you down play his disrespect at one time? did you give up the power of your own voice? did you lose yourself in the relationship and it became just one sided? did you allow him to make you doubt yourself? in others words, if you do decide to give him another chance, what would you do different? not saying that you are the blame or cause of the negative words at all, but dont allow such disrespect from him or anyone else in the future. if you do decide to give it another try, go in with a voice, with the demand of respect, with your needs and wants expressed and expected. with an increase in your self worth and confidence, you will know what to do if his actions are true or if with dishonest intentions. seek counseling as well, if you need that additional support to find self."
im feeling really guilty about something i did. what can i do to cope with my feelings?,"guilt is a normal emotion, but its important to process it in a healthy way. lets work on identifying any actions you can take to make amends and forgiving yourself. we can also explore any underlying issues that may be contributing to your guilt."
"we just cannot seem to get along. i cannot have a conversation with her without it turning into world war 3. she treats me like i have no right to an opinion and never really lets me speak. my real mother cares and tries to help me, but she cant do much, because my adoptive mother wont listen to her either.","going to see a experience counselor would be my advice. you will have a neutral person that can listen to both sides and help you all find a common ground of understanding. if she doesnt agree to counseling, really the only person you can change is you. i would suggest that you approach her with love and let her know what you appreciate about her, let her know the great things she have done that could not be replaced or forgotten however you want your relationship to get better than it has been lately. hopefully this will open the door of communication where you can explain your thoughts and feeling but in a loving way."
im struggling with addiction and its ruining my life.,addiction is a serious issue that requires professional help. lets explore treatment options and develop a plan to help you overcome your addiction and regain control of your life.
my daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10. she then started to act younger than she is. now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age. i dont know why this is happening. is this normal?,"this is certainly an important issue to look into, it is always helpful to speak with the childs pediatrician since they are most familiar with the childs developmental history. also, children tend to regress behaviorally when facing events and interactions they feel to have no control over, this can be as simple as a loss of a pet, a recent move, death in the family, andor as serious as sexual abuse, and other things. if you have not spoken to the school that can be a good starting point."
i find myself lying about small everyday things that there is really no need to lie about. how do i figure out what triggers me to do this? and how do i help overcome this problem? i would like to become more honest and open no matter the situation.,"well lets start with the awesome realization youve already had, you want to notice that you have triggers. thats huge. really. i find that when people lie, its most often as a defense mechanism. which is likely a flag that something doesnt feel safe. what exactly doesnt feel safe could be lots of different things but the key to notice is that its that feeling of insecurity that is very likely triggering you. it could really help to explore this with therapist, perhaps even someone with a trauma specialty -- thats not to say this is related to a trauma but more so to suggest that therapists specializing in trauma are very skilled at helping to identify and assist in repatterning your triggers!"
"im feeling really down and hopeless, what should i do?","its important to recognize that depression is a real illness and seeking help is a sign of strength. we can explore therapy and medication options, as well as any lifestyle changes that may improve your mood."
im struggling with low self-esteem and i dont know how to improve it.,"low self-esteem can be a difficult and pervasive issue. together, we can work on identifying negative self-talk and developing positive affirmations. we can also explore techniques such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and self-care practices."
i am feeling very stressed and anxious about a job interview. what can i do to manage my nerves?,"its common to feel nervous before a job interview. one technique that may be helpful is to practice positive self-talk and visualization. you can also try practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or yoga, before the interview. remember, its okay to be nervous and the interviewer is likely aware of this."
im having trouble with my partner. we argue a lot and i dont know how to fix things.,its common for couples to experience difficulties in their relationships. lets work on communication skills and strategies to improve your relationship.
"ive known my boyfriend for several years. we were friends for a long time. in 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him since i lived out of state. i planned to move in with him in 2014 after i finished school and he found a job. however, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time. we decided later to make it work. shortly after, i found out that i was pregnant. i wanted to tell him during his next visit. however, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money. after i gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts. soon after, i experienced a miscarriage. i texted him about what had happened, and he didnt seem to care. i was extremely hurt by this. i still decided to move back as i had originally planned. he helped me with the move and replaced the money i had lent him. during this time, i asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because i needed to know. although he says he did, i hardly ever see him. he never got a job, which was in the original plan. after that, we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together. once we got back together, i cut all ties with the former relationship i had been in. i thought he had too. but i found out that he did not attempt to do as i did and was still talking with another woman. in fact, he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her. when i confronted him about this, he wasnt apologetic. he said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone. he even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car. i dont know what to do.","there are plenty of red flags that you have been presented with:several breakups not holding up his end of the bargain regarding worklack of empathy for your miscarriagelying about his involvement with another womanphysical violence, which is of most concern. this seems to be a very unhealthy relationship. in my experience, relationships such as these rarely become positive ones. violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning (you looking through his phone), it is indefensible. you have to look at these red flags and ask yourself, is this really someone i want to marry? is he an asset to my life? i think youll realize he is not.best of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness, dignity and respect."
"i get so much anxiety, and i dont know why. i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes.","the other two post answers to your question are very good and i dont feel the need to repeat what has already been said quite well, but i will offer one other option i have been able to utilize quite successfully with those dealing with panic attacks. chain analysis is a fantastic way for your to map out the situation starting with the prompting event, the chain of events ((links) that lead up to the behavior - in this case a panic attack, and then what the

im having trouble concentrating and staying focused.,"difficulty concentrating can be a symptom of a number of different issues, such as adhd or anxiety. have you considered speaking with a healthcare professional to explore potential underlying causes and treatment options?"
im struggling with an addiction and i dont know how to stop. what can i do to get help?,seek out support from loved ones and consider attending support group meetings like alcoholics anonymous or narcotics anonymous. its important to speak with a licensed addiction counselor to determine the best course of treatment for you.
im feeling really guilty about something i did in the past.,"guilt can be a difficult emotion to manage, but its important to acknowledge and process it so you can move forward. lets work on developing strategies to manage your guilt and make amends if necessary."
"i have been married for ten years. my husband is 29 years my senior. we have a young daughter. ever since she was born, my husband has shut down. we have no intimacy he doesnt even kiss me. ive told him how i feel for years, and he swears he loves me and wants to make me happy, but i still have to literally beg for sex and affection. my self-esteem is gone, and i feel so alone. he has stranded me. he uses his passive-aggressive ways and ignores every comment i make. he refuses to talk to me in detail.","hi smyrna,your husband is avoiding dealing with this problem. i understand how lonely you must feel, not only sexually, but emotionally too.from what you describe, it seems that he wants to be there for you, but he clearly has barriers to engaging fully around this issue. my hunch is that he doesnt know what to do or how to talk to you. but i think he does have something to say.your husband is 29 years older and youve been together for ten years...that puts you at around thirty perhaps and him at almost sixty? has any wise older woman sat you down to explain that men sometimes have erectile issues or hormone-related low sex drive as they age? its possible that your husband is bewildered, angry, grieving or anxious about changes in his sex drive or his ability to maintain an erection, and that he doesnt know how to talk to you about this. he may feel like hes letting you down, and hes scared it will get worse, so hes sticking his head in the sand. of course, that doesnt help, does it?the worst case scenario is that you get angry or hopeless, that he senses danger or disapproval from you and pulls away even further in shame. eventually, you stop chasing him, and you drift further apart. its a bit of a conundrum...how to honour both your need for connection and honesty and his need for a safe place to explore his fears and insecurities. maybe lower your expectations for a bit? your husband will need to believe that you are a safe place to share his fears, and you would need to hold onto the fact that hes really scared, and that hes not rejecting you...just protecting himself.i would suggest having a gentle conversation that sounds something like sweetheart, we both know that somethings not right here. i think youve been trying to handle this on your own or hoping it would get better, but can we agree that its not? i need you to either talk to me about whats happening, or please go see a doctor. what i need is to see that you are doing some little step to help us. either of those things would show me that.in the end, you need to know that hes heard you and that hes willing to look at the issue in some way. if he does neither, then at least you know where you stand and you can decide whether to live in a sexless marriage. i wonder if showing him this answer to your question might help? just a thought."
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,"i would be more concerned with how is this being addressed in therapy. therapy can be a rewarding process, however often times we do not pay much attention to the messages being sent to our bodies. i believe in somatic therapy which deals with our mind body connection. i would think it may not be a question of normal or abnormal however if it is impacting you then you must pay attention to that. it would be helpful to explore the feelings youre having with your therapist. it may be something that needs addressing to help alleviate those feelings or have a better understanding of why they are showing up when it is time for therapy."
"he isnt violent, but he has anger issues and deep insecurities. hes working on them and has improved. we started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter. now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.","sometimes relationships just do not work. dont feel that the first, second, or even third relationship is the relationship you are suppose to be in for life. the one that is meant for you will require work but should be be draining and a constant roller coaster of breaking up. it is good you all went to counseling, but one or two sessions may not be enough to make and see a change in behavior. it takes times and it takes both working toward the same goal. i would suggest doing you...meaning focusing on your own growth at the time. if he wants to grow with you, he will make the necessary steps. if he doesnt...wish him well."
"my husband and i are separated and he doesnt even want to talk to me. he says he doesnt love me anymore, but i would do anything to get him back. is there any hope?","most important is to take care of your feelings regarding that he has left you.from your description there doesnt seem to be much hope your husband would like to keep the marriage going.has a long time passed since the two of you separated? sometimes, and really this is very rare, people decide to return to their marriage.if he impulsively decided to leave and now is a short while since he did this, then there is some hope he will decide to stay together.if hes been out of the house for a while and tells you what you wrote, then there is greater chance hes had time to think through to split and will follow through.as painful as it is to hear that someone with whom youd like to be, doesnt want to be with you, accepting your hurt feelings will eventually let you come to peace with your feelings.to keep hoping against the facts of what hes said to you, only makes your own pain intensify."
i recently lost a friend to suicide. im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. how can i handle this better?,"suicide is a very traumatic loss and affects survivors significantly. everyone deals with their grief in different ways. one way i recommend to deal with the loss of a loved one is to write letters to them. some people like to keep the letters in a jar, maybe fill the jar with sand so the letters are buried. i recommend writing the letters as often as you need to. you will notice over time the need to write the letters will decrease and the intense feelings of loss will decrease. i also recommend finding a survivors support group in your area. you can find more information on"

"i often get the feeling that im being watched, like video cameras are hidden wherever i am, even at home. i feel like people can see all that i do and are reading my thoughts. things i read or hear on the radio seem to be about (or meant for) me, and people are talking about me when they whisper.","it sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with worry about being continuously monitored, with no privacy even in your own mind, and as if people are constantly saying things about you in whispers on in the media. its hard to say from a post online what is at the root of this experience, but you may be able to get insight into that, as well as develop ways of coping with the distress of feeling this way, with the help of a good therapist. there is no pill or technique that can guarantee that this experience will go away, though it might, however, there are things that you can do so that you can understand it better and so that it does not have such an impact on your ability to lead a satisfy life."
i have been married for 11 years. within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart. we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other. i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me. i feel very alone and just uncared for. is there anything i can do to feel reconnected?,"your question highlights your pain very clearly. what you are describing is one of the most common scenarios i see in my practice with couples: one partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward. my mind immediately goes to a question for you: what happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for? what do you say to yourself about you, about your spouse, and about your relationship? what do you do in response to these feelings? do you ask for what you need? does this lead to arguments? do you stay silent or withdraw?very often, couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship (and is often seen as cold and aloof towards the relationship), and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other (and is often seen as critical and nagging). regardless of who started it, these patterns can turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own, and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship. if both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship, the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together. as the patterns slow down, partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities, needs and longings, and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesnt leave the other partner feeling criticized, threatened, abandoned, or uncared for.some couples can do this without the help of a therapist. the book hold me tight: 7 conversations for a lifetime of love by sue johnson is a self-help book based on emotionally focused therapy (the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists), and has been helpful to many couples that i see. when a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals, i recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy (such as emotionally focused therapy. you can learn more about eft or find an eft therapist here: summarize:your pain is understandable and valid. its telling you what you are missing and what you want.reconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us, express those feelings in a safe way, and assert our wantsneeds, while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partner.if you can do that on your own, and your relationship is responsive, thats fantastic! if you encounter challenges in resolving this yourself, consider therapy with a trained couples therapist using a model that is scientifically validated. pain means this is important! you and your marriage are worth the effort!"
my brother has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has not been taking his medication. hes been using methamphetamine and alcohol and was found sleeping naked in my step mom driveway in 12 degree weather. i was adopted in by his dad (who just passed) and his mother will not get involved because shes afraid of financial responsibility. do i have the rights to be able to sign my brother into mentalhealth facility?,"im sorry to hear that your brother has been having such a rough time. hes lucky to have you on his side (although he may not always see it that way).as far as whether you can sign him in, that depends on a lot of different things.i would suggest that you google the state and county that you live in as well as some phrase similar to crisis hotline. they can tell you how it works in that county. my guess is that you could sign him in as long as he met the criteria for admission at that moment, but i cant be entirely sure. you could also ask the person on the phone about financial responsibility. i have not heard of that being a problem, but i guess it would depend on insurance.if you have trouble finding a local hotline, consider calling the national crisis number (800-273-8255) and ask them to help you find someone local."

i feel like i would be more comfortable as a girl even though i still like girls. i think im like a girl stuck in a guy body. i imagine myself as a girl too. i think this more because my friends say that if i was a girl i would be a hot looking one. and i dont care about having boobs or anything. i just feel like the way that i do act will make more sense if i was a girl.,"i understand that gender andor sexual identity crises can be very difficult to navigate, although in todays time i think we have made a lot of progress and it is becoming easier for individuals to find themselves and also find acceptance from society.i am unsure how old you are. if you are a child or teenager, this is a normal time to have identity questions and to be in a phase where you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want out of life. i hope that you have understanding and supportive friends and family that you can talk to and who will support you in how you feel and what you may decide to do. a lot of people, unfortunately, do not, and if this is the case then it makes it harder for you. because then you may not feel safe exploring these feelings and decisions.i urge you not to try to make any permanent changes for quite some time. by this i mean a sex change. anything permanent like surgery or hormone replacement to change your actual gender is something that does not need to be done lightly. please find a therapist that can help you explore your feelings and your identity crisis. of course there are things that you can do that are not permanent changes. many people decide to dress like their gender of choice. maybe experimenting in this way is something that you could do.see if you have a local chapter of pflag in your area. pflag stands for parents, families and friends of lesbians and gays. they are able to help not only with those who identify as lesbian or gay, but also transgendered and asexual. i wish you all the best in your identity crisis. it would be very easy for you to sink into depression if you do not have good support and understanding from those around you during this time. find a professional that can help, especially if you experience depression or any thoughts of harming yourself."

ive been like this ever since i was in school back then i transferred to another school. now im thinking about changing my job.,"sometimes changes make sense. it may be helpful to talk to someone who you trust to get a sense of whether the changes that you are making are those that are considered adaptable or important changes that allow us all to grow. another possibility is that you are changing things in an effort to get away from something that is uncomfortable or difficult. there are many other possibilities along this continuum.i would ask you to consider the following:what is leading you to want to change your job?what feelings are associated with this change? (happy, sad, scared, anxiousnervous, confused, motivated, etc.)how is the job that you are looking to transfer to going to be better or different? are the concerns that you have now going to travel with you?if you are hesitating to get another perspective (from trusted friends or family or some sort of career advisor in your area), where is the hesitation coming from?"
"i dont know whats with me. im almost constantly angry. even when im happy, i still feel anger inside me. when i acknowledge it, it ruins my mood and takes over. i get angry at the littlest things. even if i think someone said something they didnt, it infuriates me. something perfectly normal can make me go off. when my anger flares up, i get a terrible pain in my chest that lasts for a while. its like there is a fire constantly burning in my body, and anger is gasoline.","hi nashville, im glad you want this to be different. it doesnt feel good to be angry all the time, and its stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships, im sure.working with a therapist, you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger. its likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness, and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old, tender, bruised emotion that weve simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. we develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions, and anger is one way of doing that. so, when someone looks at you in a certain way, or says something, youd rather be angry than feel powerless, or unimportant (or whatever your kryptonite feeling is). in that moment, your instinct is to blame whatever happened, no matter how small, because thats the thing that happened just before you got mad. you fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that persons face, or the shoe that someone left in front of the door...its that you cant stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if its on fire.i suggest finding a therapist to work with. you can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them. :)"

"in particular during family gatherings (such as funerals), where there are different customs.","i think the best thing you can do is be respectful of each family members wishes. although everyone may not agree with one another, the most important thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead of trying to sway them in a certain direction. there are many families that are united despite their differences. for example, a mother may be catholic and the father jewish. by introducing the children to each faith until they are ready to decide for themselves can be beneficial. also, its not uncommon for views to change as one ages or faces different life experiences. so dont get too discouraged if your child wants to explore different avenues. creating a loving and accepting environment is most essential."

ive been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for just over a year. this past week she admitted to me that she has feelings for another guy. she says its just a crush but i dont know how to cope with it. how should i deal with this?,"long distance relationships are very difficult to maintain, not just for the lack of communication, but also because of the lack of intimacy that comes along with it. even if you have spectacular communication while in a long-distance relationship, it is difficult to maintain intimacy because you are lacking in the physical contact aspect of intimacy. here, we are not talking about sex, but about the emotional connection that happens along with physical contact. it is also hard to have shared experiences when the two of you are in separate places. these are the challenges that you face, but there are some ways to improve your odds. the first thing to remember here is that dating is all about finding a person that you want to eventually dedicate your time, resources, and self to. if either of you finds that the relationship is one that you are not necessarily committed to, it is better to find out and have the opportunity to date others before a commitment is made. the second thing to remember is that open communication is a good sign in a relationship. that being said, i do not believe that sharing details about your crushes is the best thing for a relationship. instead, i would recommend working on improving the relationship as best you can. it is a wonderful thing when we can feel that we have given our best efforts on something, especially something as important as the act of loving. here are a couple things that you can do to improve even a long-distance relationship. start by downloading the gottman card decks app here while on the phone or video chat, try asking each other some of these questions so that you can build a deeper knowledge of one another. some may seem silly, but they help you know the other person more intimately. it is also helpful to make sure that you are having regular communication with each other. some situations make it very difficult to communicate, but if at all possible, daily communication via phone or video chat would be best. even if it is just for 30 minutes a day, really dedicate your time and attention to each other during those calls. next, it can be helpful to know each others love languages so you can show each other how much you really care. take the assessment for the 5 love languages and talk about the results together. you can find the assessment here: to other people is completely normal and involves biological processes. intimacy, on the other hand, creates real connection and dedication to each other. learn about each other, spend time together, and you will create intimacy."

"i am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life. i had a daughter with my ex-boyfriend. i am now married, and my husbands ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend. they also have a daughter together. my issue is that there is always drama. i am pregnant, and i told my ex-boyfriend that i dont want any drama or arguments. i want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. however, we just had an incident where my ex-boyfriend started discussing drop-off details about my stepdaughter. i told him that he needed to ask my husband because i cant make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. that led to an argument. i told him all my concern is when i pick up my daughter. my stepdaughters pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. i especially told him i didnt want to be involved. somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. he threatened me and got ugly because i wouldnt discuss my stepdaughters matters with him. the point is there is so much drama. i try my best to get along with everyone. i dont understand where i went wrong (besides replying back to his question). i feel like im going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyones frustrations are taken out on each other, and its the children that are hurting. i had a party planned for my daughters birthday, and my ex-boyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldnt let me have her. in my eyes, its the child that is hurting. i was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pick-up details about my stepdaughter, which i have no control over, he took it out on our daughter.","hi. i appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation. i agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children. children need adults around them to act maturely, cooperatively and peacefully even when they dont like each other it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing. your ex-boyfriend seems more focused on his own needs. in fact, he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive, controlling and manipulative, bordering on parental alienation. i agree this is a problem.i also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy. its not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress. honour this instinct you have. i will suggest a few things to you. first, to gather support around you, professionally if you need it, from family and friends, and certainly from your husband. if you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex, that will help. he can help run interference when it comes to his daughter. it will help you feel supported.know that your exs behaviours arent happening because you did anything wrong its the way he operates (and maybe this is why youre not with him?). you cant change him, but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression. youre correct that he will always be there, and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situation.keep on defining clear boundaries! you might sound like a broken record (youll have to talk to my husband about that), but thats okay. its okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle. its okay to not respond to texts or other communications that arent vitally important. its okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable. its okay to not engage with him more than is necessary.regarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you, i recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully. let him know what your expectations are, simply and clearly and in writing (our agreement states x, and you are not following our agreement). your daughter doesnt have to be aware i think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflict.a professional therapist can help you with all of this. i hope this helps get you started towards greater peace, at least within yourself. :)"
"for the past four weeks, ive been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things. theyre not random voices, but rather, the voices of those i care about.","i would recommend that you talk with a mental health professional near you about the details so you can have some really specific support for what you are going through.i dont know if you can understand when the voices are saying, but i wonder how you feel about what you are hearing? if the voices are just at night, is it possible that they are part of a nightmare or a dream? if you recall your nightmares, consider writing them down so that you can remember their content and work with a mental health professional to look for patterns.one thing that may help you while you are awake is to try to stay connected to the room youre in. for example, take time to notice your feet on the floor, hips in the chair, and shoulders against the back of the chair. you can also try mindfulness techniques, such as noticing what is around you or changing your breathing patterns. these ideas may help in the meantime prior to having more specific ideas from someone near you.thanks for reaching out!"
"im a male in my early 20s. lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. i then start to act weird because im trying to fight my paranoia. this leads to people starring at me because they dont know that im suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. they just notice me acting scared around kids and they think im a threat because of it. im not a pervert or predator. i would never hurt a kid. i like kids and dont know why im so scared to be around them. i dont understand why i feel like this. am i a bad person? how do i make this stop?","in our practice, many people we see have unwanted thoughts of doing harm to children - physically or sexually. as you said, these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts - not genuine desires to harm them. this is a form of ocd we often call harm or pedophilic ocd. what you are describing here as paranoia sounds similar to this, and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings, as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good person.if this is really what is going on (further assessment by the right professional would determine this), the current gold standard approach to addressing ocd is exposure with response prevention - in this case, confronting the feared situations, thoughts or images on purpose, rather than avoiding them, until they lose the fear and shame associated with them."
"my brother just broke up with his girlfriend. while they were dating for the past two years, her son spent the weekends with me and my mother. now she doesnt think her son should have any interaction with us. how should we approach the situation? is she doing the right thing for her child?","hi tampa, i get that this is a loss for all of you you have bonded with this child as a result of the significant time you have spent with him. hes a lucky boy to have had you all taking care of him. certainly, it seems that his mother might not be making the best decision for her son if you are willing to maintain the relationship, it would be good for him to still have that contact. in my book, the more people loving a child, the better. but, ultimately, she has the right to make these decisions. to oppose her wont likely do any good. you can focus on grieving this relationship and supporting your brother through his loss as well."

i feel too scared to meet people i dont know - even relatives. i dont ever raise my hand or talk in school. i feel like no one understands. how can i handle this?,"social anxiety is scary. you dont feel safe in relationships and prefer to isolate yourself from the outside world. is it something you can talk to your parents about? a school counselor could help you. the counselor could possibly order an evaluation to determine how to help.build your self confidence - start slow with your family and identify a subject you are familiar with and add to a general conversation. its important to start finding things in common with others. you dont need to carry the conversations, just add a phrase or two. have an exit strategy if you get too uncomfortable. keep notes of what worked and what didnt work so youll be prepared for your next opportunity. carpe diem!"
"he just walks in the house whenever he wants to see his kids. my fiancé tells me it makes her angry and doesnt like it, but she seems afraid to say anything to him about it for some reason. is it okay for him to do this?","the short answer to your question is no its not okay for anyone to ever be doing this. theres a lot of unanswered questions and other factors going on here that need attention. nevertheless, dont hesitate to seek out legal counsel andor call 911. ideally, your fiancé would be able to speak directly to her ex-husband and set reasonable boundaries that honor whatever legal agreements are in force resultant from the divorce and custody agreements. the fact that shes afraid to say anything to him about his inappropriate behavior, and that she hasnt been able to give you any reason for her fear, suggests possible factors of past abusive behaviors, entitlement, andor co-dependence. i hope things work out well for all and im confident a skilled therapist could help all navigate how best to set boundaries and experience greater healing."
im having trouble concentrating and i keep forgetting things.,lets talk about what might be causing those symptoms. have you been feeling stressed or overwhelmed lately?
im having trouble with my partner and we keep fighting. what can i do to improve our relationship?,"communication is key in any relationship. its important to be open and honest with your partner about your feelings and needs. consider couples therapy, where you can work with a trained professional to improve your communication and resolve conflicts in a healthy way. its also important to prioritize quality time together and engage in activities that you both enjoy."
"i was in a car accident and totaled my car. i gave up my job of nine years to pursue school full-time to better myself. i failed a class, and my boyfriend that i live with thinks im stupid and wants to break up with me. i have nowhere to go, and i feel like im losing everything.","when we feel overwhelmed by life situations, it is important to understand where the feeling is coming from. once we understand the source, it is important to normalize the situations that got us there and find balance in our lives.first, car accidents are common, and since they are accidents they are not a reflection of us. when we have an accident we feel anxious, worried, and may have some trauma after the accidents. if you have been experiencing anxiety since the car accident, talk to your doctor or therapist about it. second, a lot of people fail classes, tasks, deadlines, etc. but they dont give up on their goal. we have to remember that failing is part of the learning process, and having the courage to try again is what gives us determination and character. remind yourself what motivated you to leave your job, and the courage and determination that took to do so, then channel that energy back into school. third, when we have problems in our relationships, is helpful to look for ways to improve communication, discuss our concerns and how we want to resolve them, but it may be that the relationship needs to end if there isnt enough interest in one of the parts or if theres verbal or emotional abuse. consider talking to your boyfriend and set some boundaries regarding appropriate communication.at all times: focus on being kind to yourself and improving your self-esteem: increase self-care activities, do more things that you enjoy, meditate in what gives you peace and make an effort to have more of that in your life. at the end, you are the one in control of your life, and you determine who you become.qué puedo hacer cuando siento que mi vida está fuera de control?estuve en un accidente de auto, y fue pérdida total. deje mi trabajo de 9 años para completar un grado a tiempo completo. falle una clase, y mi novio piensa que soy estúpida, el quiere dejarme. no tengo a donde ir y siento que lo estoy perdiendo todo.cuando nos sentimos agobiados es importante reconocer donde estamos parados y entender de donde vienen esas emociones. ya que entendemos la fuente de agobio, es importante normalizar las situaciones que lo causaron, y volver a encontrar el balance en nuestra vida.primero, los accidentes de auto son comunes, y por ser accidentes no son un reflejo de nosotros o nuestras destrezas. cuando experimentamos accidentes no s sentimos ansiosos, preocupados, y puede que experimentemos algún trauma. si sientes ansiedad, extrema preocupación habla con tu doctor o terapista al respecto. segundo, muchas personas fallan clases, tareas, fechas de entrega, pero no se rinden. tenemos que recordar que fallar es parte del proceso de aprendizaje, y tener el valor de intentarlo de nuevo, es lo que nos da determinación y carácter. recuerda que te impulsó a dejar tu trabajo y canaliza esa energía en la escuela. tercero, cuando tenemos problemas en las relaciones, es importante comunicar nuestras preocupaciones y diferencias, pero puede ser que la relación termine si no hay interés mutuo o si hay algún tipo de abuso. considera hablar con tu novio y establecer límites respecto a la comunicación apropiada.en todo momento: enfócate en cuidarte a ti misma y mejorar tu autoestima, aumenta las actividades que te ayudan a sentirte bien, medita sobre lo que te paz y pasa más tiempo practicando esas actividades."

nothing weve tried has worked so far.,probably what you should do is decide whether you can continue having a romantic and sexual relationship with someone to whom you dont feel like having sex.five years is long enough to know that the way you feel toward your partner is more than likely going to remain this way.talk with your gf about your feelings because she may not wish to be in a relationship in which her partner is not sexually attracted to her.
how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"hi there, there are a number of reasons why a therapeutic relationship might end including, but not limited to the client reaching their goals, the client reaching a place of acceptance where they wish to remain or even a breach within the relationship. the last aspect should likely be taken to supervision in order to be fully processed. all of these things could happen, and usually happen organically (again, except for the last example). your question, however, was about the counselor ending treatment. this is a bit more difficult and can be very nerve-wracking. it may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision, as well. its important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client, as well. do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist, have they achieved their goals or is it something else?in regular, open-ended sessions, i try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently. in these check-ins, i use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely. i also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize. in goal-oriented sessions, i check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and i remain focused and, should they wish to shift their focus, that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goal. often, especially in longer term therapeutic relationships, we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal, however they are apprehensive about ending therapy. this is actually a great place to go with them why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you? often, having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery. that said, it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now, as the relationship seems to be ending, feels more confident in bringing these up. in the case where the relationship is a toxic one, terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you. its a difficult conversation, but recall that part of the role of the therapist is to model that these discomforts can be managed. i hope that this brief response can assist you going forward!"
how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"in general, i usually let the client decide when this should occur, sometimes with some clients it will be a joint agreement, but even in that case it should weigh mostly on what the client feels. in short, therapy ends when you feel your done.c"

"i am a really shy person. im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. how can i get more confident?","have you tried rehearsing to yourself or a trusted friend what you will present to the class? the more confident you feel in a safe space, the more chance there will be of making the same presentation to a larger group.giving presentations is not necessarily a difficulty with communication. it has more to do with performance than expressing yourself clearly.practice, practice, and practice, until you see yourself improve in how you present.also, keep in mind that whatever anxiety you may feel about making a mistake, the audience is almost alway much more forgiving than the person who feels anxious.anxiety heightens fear, so whatever concerns you have, check if they are growing from anxiety instead of a realistic assessment of your abilities or audience receptivity.good luck!"
im having trouble with my self-esteem and i dont feel good about myself. what can i do?,"start by identifying any negative self-talk or beliefs you may have about yourself. challenge these thoughts and replace them with more positive and realistic ones. practice self-care by engaging in activities that make you feel good about yourself, such as exercise or hobbies. surround yourself with supportive and positive people who uplift you. consider seeking therapy to work through any underlying issues affecting your self-esteem."
im having trouble managing my stress levels.,"stress is a normal part of life, but its important to manage it in healthy ways. lets work on developing relaxation techniques and stress-management strategies that work for you."

im having trouble getting over a breakup. what can i do to move on?,"its important to give yourself time to grieve and process your feelings after a breakup. surround yourself with supportive friends and family who can offer a listening ear and a shoulder to cry on. try to avoid contact with your ex, at least in the short-term, to give yourself space to heal. focus on self-care, whether thats through exercise, meditation, or spending time doing things you enjoy. finally, try to reframe the breakup as an opportunity for growth and self-discovery."
"when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. she is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but i am afraid she is stressing too much. im afraid its going to break her. i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.","i hear your concern that your daughter might break under the pressure and stress that she is dealing with. it is a good thing that your high achieving daughter is calling out for help and that you are listening. the education system is wrought with social and emotional problems, and there is a disproportionate emphasis on test taking, scores and achievement in school. it sounds like your daughter would benefit from some social and emotional education and learning to understand how her feelings are impacting her thoughts and behaviors. id like to also assure you that crying and freaking out is a normal part of growing up. depending on your daughters age, it is likely that she is going through a growth spurt and she may be feeling her feelings in a unique way to her too. if this is the first time you are having a concern about anxiety then rest at ease and see if you can ride the emotions with her and be a stable sounding board for her. use empathy and compassion and allow her a safe place to process through her concerns. try not to solve it for her, but allow her a space to fumble through and find her own answers to the problems she is faced with. give her confidence that she can figure it out, and be patient as you sit with her. our presence is key to our childrens well being. make eye contact with her, allow her to squirm and get frustrated and work through it while you witness her process. as parents, when we can model calm in the storm of life our children learn that all of their feelings are ok too. when our children see and feel our fear, it can create more insecurity and low self evaluation of their own efficacy to manage the stress. when we can be calm and reassuring, then we can boost their confidence in their own ability to problem solve what they are going through. lets face it we all have irrational thinking from time to time, and usually it is when we are under stress. if your daughter continues to show concerning anxiety, check with her school and see if she can benefit from an opportunity with the social emotional learning curriculum. in texas at least, schools are required to have resources for children like your daughter who are experiencing anxiety and other mental health concerns. her teacher is with her all day and you may request to have a conference with her to see if she can help her in any way as well. if resources in your school are limited then i would seek an outside therapist who specializes in working with children your daughters age. call around and see if she can benefit from a therapeutic relationship outside of school and home. once you have plenty of feedback from her teacher and a therapist or counselor then you will be able to determine if seeking medical care is necessary with their support and guidance. thank you for your courage to reach out for help on behalf of your daughter. you are her greatest advocate. i hope that you find support to help you navigate this time in her life and that you both grow and learn from this experience."
im struggling with overeating and feel really ashamed of my body. what steps can i take to feel better about myself?,"its important to remember that struggling with overeating is a common issue, and theres no shame in seeking help. a therapist could work with you to explore the root causes of your unhealthy eating habits, and help you develop new coping mechanisms. it can also be helpful to focus on self-care activities that make you feel good, like exercise or spending time outdoors. remember to be kind and patient with yourself throughout this process."
"im having trouble with social anxiety, and i struggle to interact with others.","social anxiety can be a challenging issue to address, but there are a variety of strategies we can try. have you considered exposure therapy, where we gradually expose you to social situations in a controlled environment? we can also explore relaxation techniques and possibly medication if necessary."
"whether its to a guy or girl, i always feel insecure talking, and i am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough. even when i am walking, i worry about my appearance and facial expression and such.","hi. im glad you wrote, because i think a lot of people have this same issue (to different degrees) and we dont talk about it much. you have some social anxiety that is a bit beyond what the average person might feel. most people have some amount of worry about what others might think of them, and this probably prevents us from making complete fools of ourselves so thats a good thing. but your alarm system is out of whack and you are spending too much time worrying about how you come across. as you age you understand this more, and its true...that other people really arent thinking about you much or monitoring you at all theyre too busy having the same thoughts youre having! am i good enough? do people like me, judge me...think im weird? were all concerned about how we come across far more than how others come across. like many people, you lack compassion for yourself, acceptance of yourself and confidence in yourself. my gut says that these things came from somewhere in your past. our sensitivities usually come from (as well as genetics) a specific time in our life when we experienced or felt something that was overwhelming and we end up with an alarm system that overreacts at times. without more details, its difficult to go further here. i recommend you see a therapist who does cognitive behavioural therapy, which can help you understand the roots of your fears and learn how to manage them more successfully."
"my husband and i have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. others have told me that most men would have left me by now. honestly, i think i have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. i want to be better connected with my husband.","there are a lot of different things that could be playing a role here.first, different people have unique levels of sex drive, and sometimes there is a hormonal imbalance.because you say both that there is a possibility that neither one of you actually knows what youre doing, and you want to be better connected with your husband, consider having some time where you sit together and touch each other in nonsexual ways and communicate about what you like and dont like. one person would be doing the touching and the other would be communicating. then the rules would switch. after you both become comfortable with that, you could try the same thing with touching that is sexual in nature.dr. tammy nelson is a therapist who specializes in relationships and sexual issues and she has several books and lots of other resources on her website: are actually therapists who specialize in sex therapy and if you are interested in that, you would want a therapist who is a csat (certified sex addiction therapist). this does not mean that they only specialize in sexual addiction, but they do have special training in discussing sexual elements of relationships and their training is quite extensive.in addition to connecting sexually, you may consider discussing with your husband whether each of you are aware of things that make you feel valued, special, loved, and appreciated. it may be that making positive changes related to your sex life would also improve your relationship, and vice versa."
"i am so terrified of having sex anymore because i have been told over and over that sex is dangerous even though me and my partner used both forms of protection. my partner is not happy about this and simply wants more sex, and honestly, i want to give that to her.",alot of our choices have to do with what we have been taught and partly our fear of trusting ourselves to do what is right. there is so much more going on within you than you realize. we can help you bring it to the surface. please contact us when you can and in whatever way you can to discuss whats going on with you.

"my ex-boyfriend boyfriend and i lived together. he had a two year affair with a girl and had three pregnancies with her. one was an abortion, another was a miscarriage, and then she had the third baby. they are not together, but he continues to contact me and wants me back. he has nothing to offer me.","hi attica,this is a question i think a lot of people deal with...they feel confusion about why they cant forget about or get over (or stop connecting with) someone who they absolutely know isnt good for them. in your case, part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you. for some people, honestly, its a game... to see how much power they have over you or its their need to control you. if you dont want contact from this person, its really important to give him clear messages about boundaries (dont contact me again), and then ignore all of their communications. any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour. remind yourself why you dont want to be with them. i hear you doing that already when you say he has nothing to offer me. thats great self-talk.but lets get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this. sometimes its because we still hope they will change. maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us, and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those good old days. the problem there is that, over the first few years, as intimacy grows, people tend to show more of who they are, not less. so what theyre eventually showing you is who they are and what theyre capable of. people do change and grow, but it wont happen at your pace. accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change. another reason we cant let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life. this is a normal... but not a healthy... thought. its as though we want them to stay, maybe apologize, and heal our hurts maybe make up for past mistakes. you deserve that healing, you deserve better than you got, you deserve apologies, but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasnt demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy. it is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused. if you blame yourself in any way for someones poor treatment of you, you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better. it will be impossible to let go, because you blame yourself for their behaviours.draw a line. their behaviours are about them, not you, and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them, and create physical and emotional distance. these things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance."
im having issues with my partner. how can we improve our communication?,"thank you for sharing this with me. communication is key in any relationship. we can work on building active listening skills, identifying and expressing emotions, and practicing open and honest communication. its important to also establish boundaries and learn how to compromise in order to strengthen the relationship."
"i was having a sexual relationship with a coworker. he decided he was going to get a hotel room for the weekend. before i got paid, i told him i would have 25.00, which i thought i would. but when i saw my paycheck, i could not pay the 25.00. he says i lied to him about it. he wants me to reimburse him 25.00 for the hotel room he decided to get. he stayed at the hotel, and i left. i dont think its right that he want me to reimburse him 25.00 for a hotel room he wanted to get in the first place. he is out of town right now and texted me yesterday telling me i am a liar and that i should never said i was going to have 25.00 when i knew i wasnt. i told him i had to pay rent and my rent was late. he texted me saying i need to get two or three jobs.","hello, and thank you for your question. it really is up to you to decide if you owe him the 25.00. if you feel like it is the right thing to do based on your discussion with him, then pay when you can. i am actually much more concerned with how he is treating you over 25.00. i know that it can be a lot of money if you dont have much, but that doesnt give someone the right to call you names and harass you through texts. you may want to take some time and think about your relationship and make sure that these are the qualities and behaviors you want in a sexual partner. be well,robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpcc, ncc"

"i just lost my grandpa and im having a rough time with it. i need some help to deal with the loss, but i dont think i can pay for counseling. where can i get help?","yknow, to see a man youve loved and care for pass on must make ya want to cry and weep a bunch, dont it?and, may i say to you that... (as ive long since said)... if you need to mourn, take about a week or so and mourn like your life depended on it. i mean, get to weeping, gnashing, moaning, crying, solemnness, and reflection.and then, after about a week or so, reflect on the man as if he were a well-beloved traveler... sent off on a wondrous journey that will consume and encapsulate his entire awareness... and...rather than expression vibrations of fatigue, sadness, and anger, send him the finest recollections and images you have of him, and regard him fondly...for, i think you will realize that the dead are not gone forever, but are actually extraordinarily active... and when he sees what you express out from within yourself, he experiences it himself (probably more than you know) so, why not send the very best you have out to him :)"

"my fiancé and i come from a strong christian background but both went off the straight and narrow once before. he is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that im not a virgin. he has a hard time in general accepting himself and others. his insecurities are hurting our relationship. how can i help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","this suffering and clinging to the past, especially a troubled past or a past that we dont like, may be amplified due to the christian framework that may be built into your life. i am not averse to religion, i just think that many times it puts unreasonable expectations on us and helps us to form a guilt complex or perhaps even insecurities, we are humans and humans make mistakes. you mention the straight and narrow, this is a notion that you must give up on and let go, humans can never travel the straight and narrow for their whole lives there are bounds to be mistakes, we are the most fallible species on the planet and please tell your fiance to have some mercy on himself, he is not perfect. here is a story about clinging on to things you may find useful to mediate on:once there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal river. the current of the river swept silently over them all -- young and old, rich and poor, good and evil -- the current going its own way, knowing only its own crystal self. each creature in its own manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom, for clinging was their way of life, and resisting the current was what each had learned from birth. but one creature said at last, i am tired of clinging. though i cannot see it with my eyes, i trust that the current knows where it is going. i shall let go, and let it take me where it will. clinging, i shall die of boredom. the other creatures laughed and said, fool! let go, and that current you worship will throw you tumbled and smashed against the rocks, and you will die quicker than boredom! but the one heeded them not, and taking a breath did let go, and at once was tumbled and smashed by the current across the rocks. yet in time, as the creature refused to cling again, the current lifted him free from the bottom, and he was bruised and hurt no more. and the creatures downstream, to whom he was a stranger, cried, see a miracle! a creature like ourselves, yet he flies! see the messiah, come to save us all! and the one carried in the current said, i am no more messiah than you. the river delights to lift us free, if only we dare let go. our true work is this voyage, this adventure. but they cried the more, savior! all the while clinging to the rocks, and when they looked again he was gone, and they were left alone making legends of a savior."
"when im sad and alone, i want to cut myself.","try doing something physical. if you havent exercised before, it is a good idea to get your doctors approval first, but this can be helpful.the more you can find out about when you want to cut, the easier it will be to figure out what else you can do. if you are feeling sad or angry or nervous, look at what is leading up to those feelings and talk to someone about that.you said you are alone. i would see if you can find someone that you can trust to talk with about what you are going through. this could be a parent, a friend, someone at school, a coworker, or any number of other people."
i want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it. i seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. i let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. i let men emotionally abuse me and i am at their beck and call. i am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. i feel i need the security of someone being around just to survive. i know what im doing wrong and i do it anyway just hoping things will change. how do i stop this behavior and thought process?,"it is a good thing that you have recognized that you have been in some unhealthy relationships and that you are wanting to break this pattern. you seem to have some good insight into the situation.the type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers, childhood trauma andor abuse or neglect, or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self. this is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy. i recommend a book titled boundaries: where you end and i begin by anne katherine. another book that might be helpful is codependent no more by melody beattie. in the meantime, until you can work through your personal issues, absolutely do not enter into another relationship. take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole, happy, emotionally healthy person on your own. needing another person to define you is problematic. thats too much to expect from any individual.for a relationship to be healthy and happy, both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own. that means having a clear sense of self, knowing who you are and what you want, knowing how to set healthy boundaries, and knowing how to meet your own needs. it is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time. there will be times that they wont be able to meet your needs. you have to know how to meet those yourself. when you are working on becoming the best you that you can be, eventually the right person will come into your life. then you can choose to be with someone because you want them in your life instead of feeling like you need them to complete you."
"my husband and i wouldve been married for five years come june 2016. our infant daughter just had her birthday. shortly before, he told me he wanted a divorce. he has four other children, three of which are from his first wife. he decided to end that marriage when his youngest was an infant. the children do not have a good relationship with him now. he has another child from a woman he was dating. he decided he didnt want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant. it seems to me that there is a pattern. he easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the childs life but wants a relationship with them when they are older. ive tried to research online, but im not getting any answers. he also has an unhealthy dependency on alcohol and does not believe in mental health disorders such as depression and bi-polar disorder. he also does not believe in therapy or seeking help from professionals. is there a detachment disorder or some form of mental block he could have? where do you recommend researching this?","this sounds really difficult and i can understand your motivation to get to bottom of why this behaviour has occurred - especially if your husband (who sounds like he is an ex-husband?) continues to have a relationship with you and your children. with that being said - relationships and mental health are very complicated and you are unlikely to find the answers you are looking for. in order for someone to be diagnosed with a mental illness or in order for them to identify what leads them to fall into particular patterns in relationship - they would need to be willing to seek help and honestly talk about their challenges, something that you say your ex is not willing to do. while it might be a relief to understand what is going on with him - it might be more comforting for you to get support for yourself in processing your feelings and everything that has come up for you as a result of his choices."
"after he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. now he is depressed and hopeless again.","the fact that youre reaching out for help here is really helpful.the first thing i would suggest is that you consider seeing a local mental health professional yourself to be able to talk about the details, how this is affecting you, and how you can hold onto you are while also being supportive to you husband.from the way that you describe this, i wonder what has changed since coming home from the hospital. perhaps you can have a conversation with your husband this and mention that you are asking him questions to learn more about his experience and you can discuss how you notice that things were going much better when he came home from the hospital, and now things are not as good. perhaps he can tell you about what is different so that you may know him would be most helpful to him.i also hope that you husband is still continuing with his own treatment.there may also be a local peer support telephone number for the county that you live in that they be able to help you determine whether your husband needs more immediate treatment if he is feeling hopeless again. there are national crisis telephone numbers listed below as well."

"ive got so much anger. i dont know how to control myself. my girlfriend screams at me all the time, and sometime i dont know how to deal with life. im very depressed and angry. i feel lost.","hi campbell river, you say you have anger but you dont mention how it shows. or maybe it doesnt. are you aggressive with your girlfriend? since you mention depression, i wonder if youre bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all. if this is the case, i admire your ability to not lash out at someone whos hurting you. however, if they are totally unexpressed, anger turn inward and shift into depression. when she yells at you, what do you do? is this the moment that you feel the most angry? i wouldnt be surprised anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you. something about anger...its often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions. under the anger i wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, unloved. part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them. you say you dont know how to deal with life, and i think maybe you mean you dont know how to deal with emotions. lots of people dont! this is confusing for most of us. what am i feeling? why is it so strong? im afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone (or falling apart, or feeling alone...). how do i know what to express and what to be quiet about? these are all great questions to ask yourself, and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth. i wish you well!"

how does a person start the counseling process?,"hello, there are many ways to approach a counselor and starting the process, however they all start with picking up the phone. its most definitely an uncomfortable feeling, but once that first step is taken it is often met with a wave of relief. my recommendation is always to call and speak with a therapist over the phone before scheduling an appointment. listening to how they converse, use their tone and inflection, may give you a brief insight to how they will respond to you and increase your comfort right away. you may also discover, rather quickly, that this therapist is not the right match for you.regardless of how you go about it, i like to remind all people who call, email, text or walk-in, therapists are a bit like pizzas - if you dont like the toppings, send it back! there are hundreds of therapists offering all kinds of styles of therapy - take the time to pick one that suits you."
"when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. she is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but i am afraid she is stressing too much. im afraid its going to break her. i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.","hello! first of all, thank you for paying attention to your daughter and noticing that she is concerned! it sounds like you have been a positive influence on her for her to be so focused on achievement and for her to care so deeply about her performance! based on what youve said here, i understand that you are concerned that she is overly stressed, though. i share your concern. people of all ages have meltdowns when they become overwhelmed with stress, and the negative consequences of those meltdowns can definitely have a ripple-effect into other areas of our lives.for your daughter, the thing i would want to know first is this: does she feel she has adequate healthy coping skills to manage the stress she is experiencing? because, it doesnt really matter what she is stressing on...what matters is how she deals with her stress when it threatens to overwhelm her. id like to know what, exactly, that she does when she is feeling stressed that helps her to feel better. if she has only unhealthy coping skills (for example, sleeping, shutting-down, raging, self-attack with critical self-talk, etc.), or only one or two healthy skills, we would want to teach her some additional healthy strategies to help her know that she can cope. just one risk of not addressing this issue now could be that she may come to learn that stress is unbearable which may cause her to turn to destructive or escapist strategies to avoid the discomfort, the pain of feeling hopeless, andor the negative belief that she cannot help herself. i definitely think it would be worth both your whiles to have her evaluated by her family doctor andor a professional counselor. with a counselor specifically, she could learn the needed skills as well as be evaluated for other issues that may be contributing to the issue (for example, a learned belief that she must be perfect or she is not worthy.) plus, having a neutral support person to help her meet her personal goals is always a good thing. good luck, mom and daughter!learn more about me and my practice at"

"im always listening to my husband, but it feels like he never listens to me. how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time?","thanks for reaching out. this is a great question. communication is definitely a 2-way street. one person cannot participate in a discussion. it takes a talker and a listener. furthermore, communication will breakdown if each party is only focusing on his or her agenda and is not open to what the other person is saying. since i cant ask you questions about what is going on, i am going to make a guess at one situation that comes up a lot when i work with couples. one person focuses more on solving the issue, than listening to their partner. this can be frustrating for the partner who wants to just be heard.i understand that you are working really hard to listen to him and he might not be putting as much effort into listening to you. that can be really frustrating and difficult and i want to acknowledge you for wanting to improve your relationship.one of the best strategies to gettting heard, is actually to be a good listener to someone else. i know you are probably already a good listener and for you to work on listening skills may seem counterintuitive, right? you want to get heard and now you are the one doing the listening. but this can really create more effective communication if you invest time working on doing some active listening in your relationship because then you get to model those skills for your husband and allow him to see what it feels like to be listened to and then you can even teach him some of those skills. in other words, you practice specific techniques that you can use and then teach later on. here are some skills for you to use consciously and then you can teach:pay attention and use your body language to convey that you are in the conversation. no texting or distractions. lean in. focus.listen for content and for emotion. clarify what you dont understand. try to understand the persons underlying emotions. dont rush to judgement or to changing what is going on with the person. sit in a place where you are really curious and want to understand what is going on. encourage the other person to continue speaking, nod and vocalize that you hear what they are saying.ask questions to get to understand the other persons point of view.i believe when we can model these kinds of listening skills, and the other person feels heard, they will be more likely to listen to us. if you dont find that this doesnt spill over in that way, then have a discussion about what you are practicing and that you are learning these skills to be a better listener so you can understand him better. then explain how it might be helpful if you both tried it. if there is push back from him, set up a trial period to just try the skill, perhaps for 2 weeks and see if it helps. if communication is really breaking down, then it might be time to work with a counselor who can help with these skills.best of luck to you!"
"over the course of a few days, my wife was unsure about her feelings for me due to constant intimacy issues. after she thought things through, she came to the realization that she is no longer in love or attracted romantically to me. she instead has more of a platonic love and just cares for me as just family. at that point, she said our marriage was over. now over the course of the last few days, she has taken a friendship from a coworker. she insists there is nothing more than friends, but she has spent all her free time with him.","hi portland,this must feel like your world is turned upside down, for your wife to declare her confusion, followed closely by resignation, followed closely by a new friend. i get how upsetting this is.if i was your therapist, id want to explore this a good deal, because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening. be careful not to jump to conclusions. sometimes people have been slowly falling out of love for a long time, and often this is due to some (perhaps unnamed) unmet need in the marriage. she may have been coming to this point over a period of time, and has only finally said so. its also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisis...shes changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it. only she can help herself through this (she could get the help of a therapist, but its not your place to tell her to do this). or, its possible shes met this new friend and her attachment to him has clouded her view, or clarified something for her. right now, its important that you respect your wifes decision to separate, if shes asking for that. we cant trap people in a marriage. if she needs separation, or distance, then its respectful to give her that.that doesnt mean that you have to give up on the marriage right now. i would seek the support of a therapist who can help you sort out what you want whether its to move on with your life, or wait patiently for a period of time. i cant predict what will happen here. but you can find out what the best path for you is. i wish you the best."
"the sounds of eating and breathing gives me headachesmostly mouth breathing and snoring. it makes me angry, and i want to solve it myself.","probably good to know in what type of situations you are, in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring.if youre sleeping beside your partner who does these actions, would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen.basically, if the person who does these actions which bother you, start by telling them.depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds, or not, willing to change, or not, has a good deal to do with next steps.i dont really see any step youre able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head.one path i dont recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered, or dismissing your own sensitivity someone.your needs matter."

"i keep having these random thoughts that i dont want. things like you arent worth anything. i know theyre my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it. what is wrong with me, and how can i stop having these thoughts?","first off, there is nothing wrong with you. in fact, having random thoughts we feel we cannot control is actually quite common and normal. sometimes our thoughts think they are protecting us (if we think we arent worth anything, it wont hurt when we get rejected) but they are actually doing quite the opposite. they are keeping us stuck and creating a self-prophization. (if i think i am not worth anything, i dont have to try, and i will keep proving to myself that i am not worth anything). there are many techniques to work through and start to change our negative self-talk. there are actually many self-help workbooks that can help with this as well. a technique i like to use is meditation or mindfulness. this can teach us to accept our thoughts (not fight them) and then learn to let them go. release the power they have on us. if we can learn to release these and not ruminate on them, this will give us the space to allow more positive and supportive thoughts to come in. mantras can help with this as well (i am worth a lot, i am important, i have value). saying these to yourself everyday over and over (even if at first you dont believe) can retrain our brains to believe it (and allow us to believe it). i have even wrote positive mantras to myself in my bathroom mirror so i am forced to look at these throughout the day.please remember to not be hard on yourself as you begin to attempt to change the automatic thought patterns. it took a while for you to get where you are and it will take a while for this change to kick in and feel normal. so allow the process to happen slowly and allow yourself to accept you as the amazing and brave person you are."
"im depressed. i have been for years. i hide it from everyone because im scared of the reactions ill get. last time i tried telling my parents, it was a huge argument about me being too young to be depressed (im a legal adult), calling me ungrateful, and telling me that if i cant handle things now, its only going to get worse in the future (which is turning out to be true). its exhausting pretending to be okay, and i dont know how much longer i can try. im just really tired, and sadly, i cant afford the help i need on my own.","dont think that you cant afford the help you need on your own. there are several counselors that see people on a sliding scale that can be as low as 5 (based on your income). find a center that is non-profit, they have great counselors as well. it sounds like you know what you are experiencing and know that you need someone to talk to, someone that is willing to listen. your parents may not understand what your are feeling right now and that is not totally abnormal.i would encourage you to seek help immediately so you can live the best live you can...which is not being depressed."
